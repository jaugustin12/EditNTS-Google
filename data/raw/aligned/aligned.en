under conditions of high humidity , the rate of evaporation of sweat from the skin decreases .
the lack of oxygen above 2,400 metres ( 8,000 ft ) can cause serious illnesses such as altitude sickness , high altitude pulmonary edema , and high altitude cerebral edema .
the human body can adapt to high altitude by breathing faster , having a higher heart rate , and adjusting its blood chemistry .

arm-onset patients may experience difficulty with tasks requiring manual dexterity such as buttoning a shirt , writing , or turning a key in a lock .
other presenting symptoms include trouble swallowing , cramping , or stiffness of affected muscles ; muscle weakness affecting an arm or a leg ; and\/or slurred and nasal speech .
the disorder causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body due to the degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons .
unable to function , the muscles weaken and exhibit atrophy .
about 75 % of people contracting the disease experience `` limb onset '' als , i.e. , first symptoms in the arms or legs .
these patients first notice difficulty speaking clearly or swallowing .
patients with the leg onset form may experience awkwardness when walking or running or notice that they are tripping or stumbling , often with a `` dropped foot '' which drags gently along the ground .
susceptible animals include cattle , water buffalo , sheep , goats , pigs , antelope , deer , and bison .
north america and australia have been free of fmd for many years .
just as humans may spread the disease by carrying the virus on their clothes and bodies , animals that are not susceptible to the disease may still aid in spreading it .
such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common bacteria and viruses found in , around and secreted from the genital regions .
there is an increased risk of sti transmission if the receiving partner has wounds on his genitals , or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in his or her mouth , or bleeding gums .
these wounds , even when they are microscopic , increase the chances of contracting stis that can be transmitted orally under these conditions .
chlamydia , human papillomavirus ( hpv ) , gonorrhea , herpes , hepatitis ( multiple strains ) , and other sexually transmitted infections ( stis\/stds ) , can be transmitted through oral sex .
brushing the teeth , flossing , undergoing dental work soon before or after giving fellatio can also increase the risk of transmission , because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth .
any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids , poses a risk of infection .
risk of sti infection , however , is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex , with hiv transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex .
human fertility depends on factors of nutrition , sexual behavior , culture , instinct , endocrinology , timing , economics , way of life , and emotions .
in postmenarchal girls , about 80 % of the cycles are anovulatory in the first year after menarche , 50 % in the third and 10 % in the sixth year .
as a measure , `` fertility rate '' is the number of offspring born per mating pair , individual or population .
according to a computer simulation run by henri leridon , phd , an epidemiologist with the french institute of health and medical research , of women trying to get pregnant , without using fertility drugs or in vitro fertilization studies of actual couples trying to conceive have come up with higher results : one 2004 study of 770 european women found that 82 % of 35-to-39-year-old women conceived within a year , while another in 2013 of 2,820 danish women saw 78 % of 35-to-40-year-olds conceive within a year .

methylene blue has been used in those not responsive to other measures due to its presumed effect of relaxing smooth muscle .
people with atopic diseases such as asthma , eczema , or allergic rhinitis are at high risk of anaphylaxis from food , latex , and radiocontrast but not from injectable medications or stings .
anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death .
one study in children found that 60 % had a history of previous atopic diseases , and of those who die from anaphylaxis more than 90 % have asthma .
worldwide , 0.05-2 % of the population is estimated to have anaphylaxis at some point in life , and rates appear to be increasing .
other features may include a runny nose and swelling of the conjunctiva .
skin testing is available to confirm penicillin allergies , but is not available for other medications .
while a fast heart rate caused by low blood pressure is more common , a bezold-jarisch reflex has been described in 10 % of cases , where a slow heart rate is associated with low blood pressure .
pseudoanaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions are a type of anaphylaxis that does not involve an allergic reaction but is due to direct mast cell degranulation .
these include agents such as contrast medium , opioids , temperature ( hot or cold ) , and vibration .
anaphylactic shock is associated with systemic vasodilation that causes low blood pressure which is by definition 30 % lower than the person 's baseline or below standard values .
intravenous epinephrine however has been associated both with dysrhythmia and myocardial infarction .
it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish anaphylaxis from asthma , syncopy , and panic attacks .
in the immunologic mechanism , immunoglobulin e ( ige ) binds to the antigen ( the foreign material that provokes the allergic reaction ) .
non-immunologic mechanisms involved substances that directly cause the degranulation of mast cells and basophils .
the most common areas affected include : skin ( 80-90 % ) , respiratory ( 70 % ) , gastrointestinal ( 30-45 % ) , heart and vasculature ( 10-45 % ) , and central nervous system ( 10-15 % ) with usually two or more being involved .
those with underlying coronary disease are at greater risk of cardiac effects from anaphylaxis .
the wheezing is typically caused by spasms of the bronchial muscles while stridor is related to upper airway obstruction secondary to swelling .
on a mechanistic level , anaphylaxis is caused by the release of mediators from certain types of white blood cells triggered either by immunologic or non-immunologic mechanisms .
the precise location of storage is unknown , but the temporal cortex has been proposed as a likely candidate .
the cause of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown , but established risk factors include male sex , smoking , and a family history of pneumothorax .

however , in infants , hiv\/aids patients , and others with weakened immunity , infection can cause serious and occasionally fatal illness ( toxoplasmosis ) .
although mild , flu-like symptoms occasionally occur during the first few weeks following exposure , infection with t. gondii generally produces no symptoms in healthy human adults .
infection in humans and other warm-blooded animals can occur although t. gondii can infect , be transmitted by , and asexually reproduce within humans and virtually all other warm-blooded animals , the parasite can sexually reproduce only within the intestines of members of the cat family ( felids ) .
in humans , it is one of the most common parasites ; serological studies estimate that up to a third of the global population has been exposed to and may be chronically infected with t. gondii , although infection rates differ significantly from country to country .

the development of quarantine in the medieval period helped mitigate the effects of other infectious diseases .
in other cases , treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing its spread to others , such as during an outbreak of infectious disease , or contamination of food or water supplies .
dramatic increases in average life span in the late 19th century and 20th century , is widely credited to public health achievements , such as vaccination programs and control of many infectious diseases including polio , diphtheria , yellow fever and smallpox ; effective health and safety policies such as road traffic safety and occupational safety ; improved family planning ; tobacco control measures ; and programs designed to decrease non-communicable diseases by acting on known risk factors such as a person 's background , lifestyle and environment .

the presence of igm in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection , whereas igg indicates an infection sometime in the past .
immune responses can also be produced by vaccines , which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection .
viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus .
not all virus infections produce a protective immune response in this way .
however , some viruses including those that cause aids and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections .
they are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme , e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine .
when the adaptive immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus , it produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and often render it non-infectious .
this comprises cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner .
when such a virus infects a cell , it releases its rna molecule or molecules , which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the rna into smaller pieces .
examples of the second type are the hepadnaviridae , which includes hepatitis b virus .
other viruses , called neurotropic viruses , are disseminated by neural spread where the immune system may be unable to reach them .
bacteria , like plants , have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell .
this may be due to a lowered immunity in general ( diabetes , steroid use , hiv infection , age ) or because the host 's immune system does not have a b cell capable of generating antibodies to that antigen .
pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases , because there is little revenue potential .
vaccines do not guarantee complete protection from a disease .
even if the host develops antibodies , the human immune system is not perfect and in any case the immune system might still not be able to defeat the infection immediately .
one challenge in vaccine development is economic : many of the diseases most demanding a vaccine , including hiv , malaria and tuberculosis , exist principally in poor countries .
beside the active vaccine itself , the following excipients are commonly present in vaccine preparations : many vaccines need preservatives to prevent serious adverse effects such as staphylococcus infection , which in one 1928 incident killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative .
although the benefits of preventing suffering and death from serious infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare adverse effects following immunization , disputes have arisen over the morality , ethics , effectiveness , and safety of vaccination .
vaccines can be prophylactic ( example : to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or `` wild '' pathogen ) , or therapeutic ( e.g. , vaccines against cancer are also being investigated ; see cancer vaccine ) .
a vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe , its toxins or one of its surface proteins .
examples include the viral diseases yellow fever , measles , rubella , and mumps , and the bacterial disease typhoid .
it can be an irritant to people with respiratory conditions such as asthma or bronchitis .

the united states environmental protection agency defines food waste for the united states as `` uneaten food and food preparation wastes from residences and commercial establishments such as grocery stores , restaurants , and produce stands , institutional cafeterias and kitchens , and industrial sources like employee lunchrooms '' .
definitions also vary because certain groups do not consider ( or have traditionally not considered ) food waste to be a waste material , due to its applications .
some of the food waste produced by processing can be difficult to reduce without affecting the quality of the finished product .
in subsistence agriculture , the amounts of food waste are unknown , but are likely to be insignificant by comparison , due to the limited stages at which waste can occur , and given that food is grown for projected need as opposed to a global marketplace demand .
losses in the nutritional value , caloric value and edibility of crops , by extremes of temperature , humidity or the action of micro-organisms , also account for food waste ; these `` qualitative losses '' are more difficult to assess than quantitative ones .
although this can conflict with efforts to reuse food waste ( such as in animal feed ) , safety regulations are in place to ensure the health of the consumer ; they are vitally important , especially in the processing of foodstuffs of animal origin ( e.g. meat and dairy products ) , as contaminated products from these sources can lead to and are associated with microbiological and chemical hazards .

the cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza .
symptoms are mostly due to the body 's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves .
the viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment ( over 18 hours for rhinoviruses ) and can be picked up by people 's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs .
this may occur due to cold induced changes in the respiratory system , decreased immune response , and low humidity increasing viral transmission rates , perhaps due to dry air allowing small viral droplets to disperse farther and stay in the air longer .

further variation exists ; thus , specific influenza strain isolates are identified by a standard nomenclature specifying virus type , geographical location where first isolated , sequential number of isolation , year of isolation , and ha and na subtype .
this reduced rate of antigenic change , combined with its limited host range ( inhibiting cross species antigenic shift ) , ensures that pandemics of influenza b do not occur .
sixteen h subtypes ( or serotypes ) and nine n subtypes of influenza a virus have been identified .
the first three genera contain viruses that cause influenza in vertebrates , including birds ( see also avian influenza ) , humans , and other mammals .
the serotypes that have been confirmed in humans , ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths , are : influenza b virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen , and is less common than influenza a. the only other animal known to be susceptible to influenza b infection is the seal .
examples of the nomenclature are : the type a viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and cause the most severe disease .
influenza a viruses are further classified , based on the viral surface proteins hemagglutinin ( ha or h ) and neuraminidase ( na or n ) .
however , influenza c is less common than the other types and usually seems to cause mild disease in children .
this type of influenza mutates at a rate 2-3 times lower than type a and consequently is less genetically diverse , with only one influenza b serotype .
as a result of this lack of antigenic diversity , a degree of immunity to influenza b is usually acquired at an early age .
influenza a and c infect multiple species , while influenza b almost exclusively infects humans .
the influenza c virus infects humans and pigs , and can cause severe illness and local epidemics .
there are three genera of influenza virus : influenzavirus a , influenzavirus b and influenzavirus c. each genus includes only one species , or type : influenza a virus , influenza b virus , and influenza c virus , respectively .
however , influenza b mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible .

in 1765 , dr john fewster published a paper in the london medical society entitled `` cow pox and its ability to prevent smallpox '' , but he did not pursue the subject further .
moreover , he demonstrated that the protective cowpox pus could be effectively inoculated from person to person , not just directly from cattle .
jenner inoculated phipps in both arms that day , subsequently producing in phipps a fever and some uneasiness , but no full-blown infection .
in the years following 1770 , at least five investigators in england and germany ( sevel , jensen , jesty 1774 , rendell , plett 1791 ) successfully tested a cowpox vaccine in humans against smallpox .
donald hopkins has written , `` jenner 's unique contribution was not that he inoculated a few persons with cowpox , but that he then proved ( by subsequent challenges ) that they were immune to smallpox .
noting the common observation that milkmaids were generally immune to smallpox , jenner postulated that the pus in the blisters that milkmaids received from cowpox ( a disease similar to smallpox , but much less virulent ) protected them from smallpox .
for example , dorset farmer benjamin jesty successfully vaccinated and presumably induced immunity with cowpox in his wife and two children during a smallpox epidemic in 1774 , but it was not until jenner 's work some 20 years later that the procedure became widely understood .
edward jenner , frs ( 17 may 1749 - 26 january 1823 ) was an english physician and scientist from berkeley , gloucestershire , who was the pioneer of smallpox vaccine , the world 's first vaccine .
he scraped pus from cowpox blisters on the hands of sarah nelmes , a milkmaid who had caught cowpox from a cow called blossom , whose hide now hangs on the wall of the st george 's medical school library ( now in tooting ) .
he died on may 8 , 1985 , of lung fibrosis , at sacred heart general hospital in the neighboring city of eugene .
before regular communication had been established between the two hemispheres , the varieties of domesticated animals and infectious diseases that jumped to humans , such as smallpox , were strikingly more numerous in the old world than in the new .
inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection or irritation .
the flushing action of tears and saliva helps prevent infection of the eyes and mouth .
the bone marrow of a normal healthy adult produces more than 100 billion neutrophils per day , and more than 10 times that many per day during acute inflammation .
innate immune systems provide immediate defense against infection , and are found in all classes of plant and animal life .
also , mucus traps infectious agents .
histamine dilates blood vessels , causing the characteristic signs of inflammation , and recruits neutrophils and macrophages .
the innate leukocytes include : natural killer cells , mast cells , eosinophils , basophils ; and the phagocytic cells including macrophages , neutrophils , and dendritic cells , and function within the immune system by identifying and eliminating pathogens that might cause infection .
neutrophils , along with two other cell types ; eosinophils and basophils ( see below ) , are known as granulocytes due to the presence of granules in their cytoplasm , or as polymorphonuclear cells ( pmns ) due to their distinctive lobed nuclei .
in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract , movement due to peristalsis or cilia , respectively , helps remove infectious agents .
the phagocytic cells of the immune system include macrophages , neutrophils , and dendritic cells .
pathogens also stimulate the macrophage to produce chemokines , which summons other cells to the site of infection .
neutrophils are the most abundant type of phagocyte , normally representing 50 to 60 % of the total circulating leukocytes , and are usually the first cells to arrive at the site of an infection .
the innate immune system , also known as non-specific immune system and first line of defense , is a subsystem of the overall immune system that comprises the cells and mechanisms that defend the host from infection by other organisms in a non-specific manner .
inflammation is stimulated by chemical factors released by injured cells and serves to establish a physical barrier against the spread of infection , and to promote healing of any damaged tissue following the clearance of pathogens .
by helping to remove dead cells preceding growth and development of new healthy cells , phagocytosis is an important part of the healing process following tissue injury .
the major functions of the vertebrate innate immune system include : the epithelial surfaces form a physical barrier that is impermeable to most infectious agents , acting as the first line of defense against invading organisms .
the main products of the neutrophil respiratory burst are strong oxidizing agents including hydrogen peroxide , free oxygen radicals and hypochlorite .
chemical factors produced during inflammation ( histamine , bradykinin , serotonin , leukotrienes , and prostaglandins ) sensitize pain receptors , cause vasodilation of the blood vessels at the scene , and attract phagocytes , especially neutrophils .
when host cells die , either internally induced by processes involving programmed cell death ( also called apoptosis ) or caused by cell injury due to a bacterial or viral infection , phagocytic cells are responsible for their removal from the affected site .
although his time there was marked by variable health from asthma attacks , he nevertheless became an intellectual hero of the whigs .
events that happened during locke 's lifetime include the english restoration , the great plague of london and the great fire of london .
in 1666 , he met lord anthony ashley cooper , 1st earl of shaftesbury , who had come to oxford seeking treatment for a liver infection .
locke 's medical knowledge was put to the test when shaftesbury 's liver infection became life-threatening .
locke coordinated the advice of several physicians and was probably instrumental in persuading shaftesbury to undergo an operation ( then life-threatening itself ) to remove the cyst .
the newer aspartame-free drinks can also be safely consumed by phenylketonurics , because they do not contain phenylalanine .

the 1997 classification divided dengue into undifferentiated fever , dengue fever , and dengue hemorrhagic fever .
dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma .
terms for severe disease include `` infectious thrombocytopenic purpura '' and `` philippine '' , `` thai '' , or `` singapore hemorrhagic fever '' .
dengue has become a global problem since the second world war and is endemic in more than 110 countries .
typically , people infected with dengue virus are asymptomatic ( 80 % ) or only have mild symptoms such as an uncomplicated fever .
the world health organization 's 2009 classification divides dengue fever into two groups : uncomplicated and severe .
a decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0.5-6 % of severe cases , which is attributable either to inflammation of the brain by the virus or indirectly as a result of impairment of vital organs , for example , the liver .
dengue virus is primarily transmitted by aedes mosquitoes , particularly a. aegypti .
therefore , travelers returning from endemic areas are unlikely to have dengue if fever or other symptoms start more than 14 days after arriving home .
other neurological disorders have been reported in the context of dengue , such as transverse myelitis and guillain-barré syndrome .
other historical terms include `` breakheart fever '' and `` la dengue '' .
symptoms include fever , headache , muscle and joint pains , and a characteristic skin rash that is similar to measles .
the characteristic symptoms of dengue are sudden-onset fever , headache ( typically located behind the eyes ) , muscle and joint pains , and a rash .
dengue hemorrhagic fever was subdivided further into grades i-iv .
it is not entirely clear why secondary infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome .
the term `` breakbone fever '' was applied by physician and united states founding father benjamin rush , in a 1789 report of the 1780 epidemic in philadelphia .
in a small proportion of cases the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever , resulting in bleeding , low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage , or into dengue shock syndrome , where dangerously low blood pressure occurs .
the term dengue fever came into general use only after 1828 .
slaves in the west indies having contracted dengue were said to have the posture and gait of a dandy , and the disease was known as `` dandy fever '' .
infection of the heart and acute liver failure are among the rarer complications .
all tests may be negative in the early stages of the disease .
dengue fever ( uk \/ ˈdɛŋɡeɪ \/ or us \/ ˈdɛŋɡiː \/ ) , also known as breakbone fever , is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus .
dengue can occasionally affect several other body systems , either in isolation or along with the classic dengue symptoms .
some petechiae ( small red spots that do not disappear when the skin is pressed , which are caused by broken capillaries ) can appear at this point , as may some mild bleeding from the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose .
the origins of the spanish word dengue are not certain , but it is possibly derived from dinga in the swahili phrase ka-dinga pepo , which describes the disease as being caused by an evil spirit .
there may also be organ dysfunction and severe bleeding , typically from the gastrointestinal tract .
tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies , types igg and igm , can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection .
the peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system ; some textbooks also include sensory systems .
the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) is the part of the nervous system consisting of the nerves and ganglia outside of the brain and spinal cord .
range of mim codes : method of inheritance these codes have been used in the medical literature to provide a unified index to genetic diseases .
wherever a trait defined in this dictionary has a mim number , the number from the 12th edition of mim , is given in square brackets with or without an asterisk ( asterisks indicate that the mode of inheritance is known ; a number symbol ( # ) before an entry number means that the phenotype can be caused by mutation in any of two or more genes ) as appropriate e.g. , pelizaeus-merzbacher disease ( mim # 312080 ) is an x-linked recessive disorder .
every disease and gene is assigned a six digit number of which the first number classifies the method of inheritance .
online mendelian inheritance in man ( omim ) is a database that catalogues all the known diseases with a genetic component , and - when possible - links them to the relevant genes in the human genome and provides references for further research and tools for genomic analysis of a catalogued gene .

since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus , the presence of nonreactive h3n2 siv variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of h3n2 viruses .
the united states department of agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick , it does not block infection or shedding of the virus .
the swine flu in humans is most contagious during the first five days of the illness , although some people , most commonly children , can remain contagious for up to ten days .
avian influenza virus h3n2 is endemic in pigs in china , and has been detected in pigs in vietnam , increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains .
swine influenza virus ( siv ) or swine-origin influenza virus ( s-oiv ) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs .
swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide .
these h5n1 infections may be quite common ; in a survey of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in west java , where avian flu had broken out , five of the pig samples contained the h5n1 virus .
vaccines are available for different kinds of swine flu .
as of 2009 , the known siv strains include influenza c and the subtypes of influenza a known as h1n1 , h1n2 , h2n1 , h3n1 , h3n2 , and h2n3 .
influenza viruses infect both humans and pigs , but do not infect birds .
these strains of swine flu rarely pass from human to human .
swine influenza , also called pig influenza , swine flu , hog flu and pig flu , is an infection caused by any one of several types of swine influenza viruses .
of the three genera of influenza viruses that cause human flu , two also cause influenza in pigs , with influenza a being common in pigs and influenza c being rare .
in 1998 , swine flu was found in pigs in four u.s. states .
prevention of human-to-human transmission influenza spreads between humans when infected people cough or sneeze , then other people breathe in the virus or touch something with the virus on it and then touch their own face .
because these symptoms are not specific to swine flu , a differential diagnosis of probable swine flu requires not only symptoms , but also a high likelihood of swine flu due to the person 's recent history .
because of its limited host range and the lack of genetic diversity in influenza c , this form of influenza does not cause pandemics in humans .
females are only fertile during certain phases of the tidal cycle ; the ability to perceive the phase of the moon may therefore help prevent wasted mating efforts .

the term chlamydia infection can also refer to infection caused by any species belonging to the bacterial family chlamydiaceae .
chlamydia is a major infectious cause of human genital and eye disease .
chlamydia conjunctivitis or trachoma is a common cause of blindness worldwide .
if left untreated , chlamydial infections can cause serious reproductive and other health problems with both short-term and long-term consequences .
chlamydia can be transmitted during vaginal , anal , or oral sex , and can be passed from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth .
between half and three-quarters of all women who have a chlamydia infection of the cervix ( cervicitis ) have no symptoms and do not know that they are infected .
chlamydia infection ( from the greek , χλαμύδα meaning `` cloak '' ) is a common sexually transmitted infection in humans caused by the bacterium chlamydia trachomatis .
chlamydia infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide ; it is estimated that about 1 million individuals in the united states are infected with chlamydia .
bacterial croup may be divided into laryngeal diphtheria , bacterial tracheitis , laryngotracheobronchitis , and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis .
other viral causes include influenza a and b , measles , adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) .
in cases of possible secondary bacterial infection , the antibiotics vancomycin and cefotaxime are recommended .
the most common bacteria implicated are staphylococcus aureus , streptococcus pneumoniae , hemophilus influenzae , and moraxella catarrhalis .
laryngeal diphtheria is due to corynebacterium diphtheriae while bacterial tracheitis , laryngotracheobronchitis , and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis are usually due to a primary viral infection with secondary bacterial growth .
while epinephrine typically produces a reduction in croup severity within 10-30 minutes , the benefits last for only about 2 hours .
drooling or a very sick appearance indicate other medical conditions .
in severe cases associated with influenza a or b , the antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors may be administered .
spasmodic croup is caused by the same group of viruses as acute laryngotracheitis , but lacks the usual signs of infection ( such as fever , sore throat , and increased white blood cell count ) .
corticosteroids , such as dexamethasone and budesonide , have been shown to improve outcomes in children with all severities of croup .
viral croup or acute laryngotracheitis is caused by parainfluenza virus , primarily types 1 and 2 , in 75 % of cases .
while other treatments for croup have been studied , none have sufficient evidence to support their use .
croup is characterized by a `` barking '' cough , stridor , hoarseness , and difficult breathing which usually worsens at night .
moderate to severe croup may be improved temporarily with nebulized epinephrine .
since croup is usually a viral disease , antibiotics are not used unless secondary bacterial infection is suspected .
during this time , the female feeds the developing offspring with a milky substance secreted by a modified gland in the uterus .

human infections with these viruses are typically incidental , as humans are unable to replicate the virus to high enough titers to reinfect arthropods needed to continue the virus life cycle - man is a dead end host .
for example , early tests with yellow fever showed that the disease is not contagious .
the name `` yellow fever '' originated from its propensity to cause yellow jaundice in victims .
some types of recessive gene disorders confer an advantage in certain environments when only one copy of the gene is present .
most genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or millions .
the same disease , such as some forms of cancer , may be caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people , by new mutations in other people , and mainly by environmental causes in still other people .
a genetic disorder is an illness caused by one or more abnormalities in the genome , especially a condition that is present from birth ( congenital ) .
genetic disorders may or may not be heritable , i.e. , passed down from the parents ' genes .

thorndike 's key observation was that learning was promoted by positive results , which was later refined and extended by b.f. skinner 's operant conditioning .
max ferdinand perutz , om , ch , cbe , frs ( 19 may 1914 - 6 february 2002 ) was an austrian-born british molecular biologist , who shared the 1962 nobel prize for chemistry with john kendrew , for their studies of the structures of hemoglobin and globular proteins .
the heterozygote has a permanent advantage ( a higher fitness ) so long as malaria exists ; and it has existed as a human parasite for a long time .
such a balance is seen more simply in sickle-cell anemia , which is found mostly in tropical populations in africa and india .
the sickle-cell variant survives in the population because the heterozygote is resistant to malaria and the malarial parasite kills a huge number of people each year .
because the heterozygote survives , so does the hgbs allele survive at a rate much higher than the mutation rate ( see and refs in sickle-cell disease ) .
an individual homozygous for the recessive sickle hemoglobin , hgbs , has a short expectancy of life , whereas the life expectancy of the standard hemoglobin ( hgba ) homozygote and also the heterozygote is normal ( though heterozygote individuals will suffer periodic problems ) .
this is balancing selection or genetic polymorphism , balanced between fierce selection against homozygous sickle-cell sufferers , and selection against the standard hgba homozygotes by malaria .
the most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is executive function .
many authors have indicated an integral link between a person 's personality and the functions of the prefrontal cortex .
the prefrontal cortex , also called pfc , refers to the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain , lying in front of the motor and premotor areas .
lady burdett-coutts died of acute bronchitis at her home on stratton street , piccadilly .
trans fats may significantly increase the risk of coronary heart disease .
the authors added that measurement of bpa levels in serum and other body fluids suggests the possibilities that bpa intake is much higher than accounted for , and\/or that bpa can bioaccumulate in some conditions ( such as pregnancy ) .
the authors concluded that bpa imitates the sex hormone 17b-estradiol , which leads to a rise in insulin and eventually resistance which can lead to type 2 diabetes and hypertension a panel convened by the national toxicology program ( ntp ) of the u.s. national institutes of health determined that there was `` some concern '' about bpa 's effects on fetal and infant brain development and behavior .
the chapel hill consensus statement stated that average bpa levels in people were above those that cause harm to many animals in laboratory experiments .
the vaginal opening is much larger than the urethral opening , and both openings are protected by the labia .
the human vagina is an elastic muscular canal that extends from the cervix to the vulva .
during birth , the elasticity of the vagina allows it to stretch to many times its normal diameter .
the length is approximately 7.5 cm ( 2.5 to 3 in ) across the anterior wall ( front ) , and 9 cm ( 3.5 in ) long across the posterior wall ( rear ) , making the posterior fornix deeper than the anterior .
during childbirth , the vagina provides the channel to deliver the newborn from the uterus to its independent life outside the body of the mother .
in humans , the vagina leads from the opening of the vulva to the uterus ( womb ) , but the vaginal tract ends at the cervix .

he was severely injured after falling from a truck , breaking his collarbone and sustaining a severe hit to the head .
the ability to generate memory cells following a primary infection and the consequent rapid immune activation and response to succeeding infections by the same antigen is fundamental to the role t and b cells play in the adaptive immune response .
nk cells provide rapid responses to virally infected cells and respond to tumor formation , acting at around 3 days after infection .

this idea is based on the fact that patients suffering from the fragile x syndrome , caused by a deficiency of the fmr1 gene often show autistic symptoms .
a good mouse model for the fragile x syndrome is available in the form of mice in which the fmr1 gene ( the mouse homolog of the human fmr1 gene ) has been invalidated .
when mice are exposed to unpredictable chronic mild stress ( ucms ) , they start exhibiting symptoms reminiscent of major depressive disorder in humans .
however , the results were strain - and sex-specific and there did not appear to be a clear-cut correlation between the different changes , so that they finally concluded that although their data do not disprove the idea that deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis solely underlie the behavioral impairments observed in human psychiatric disorders such as depression , they do not provide support for this hypothesis either .
as expected , when mice from a strain with scant iipmf projections were rendered hyperthyroid , they showed enlarged iipmf and improved learning ability on the radial maze .
rachel 's second daughter , lucy , underwent fetal surgery for spina bifida and was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy .
doctors worried that , due to her cerebral palsy , lucy would never be able to speak or use sign language to communicate with her deaf sister , but after production of the first volume , lucy began to sign , and later , to speak .
lucy was born 8 weeks premature , with spina bifida and cerebral palsy .
this arrangement of eukaryota ( also called `` eukarya '' ) , bacteria , and archaea is called the three-domain system , replacing the traditional two-empire system .
in 1977 , carl woese proposed dividing prokaryotes into the bacteria and archaea ( originally eubacteria and archaebacteria ) because of the major differences in the structure and genetics between the two groups of organisms .
well-known examples are former united states president ronald reagan and irish writer iris murdoch , both of whom were the subjects of scientific articles examining how their cognitive capacities deteriorated with the disease .

there has been at least one case report of red bull overdose causing postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in a young athlete .
it is believed , but was not proven , that she suffered from a rare heart condition called long qt syndrome .
a february 3 , 2009 article in the daily telegraph called `` red bull ` may have triggered heart condition that killed student ' '' reported the death of a 21-year-old woman who died after drinking four cans of red bull as well as alcohol at `` social levels '' .
after visiting thailand in 1982 mateschitz had discovered that krating daeng helped cure his jet lag .
she was on medication for epilepsy and had an abnormally large heart .
as is the case with other caffeinated beverages , red bull drinkers may experience adverse effects as a result of overuse caffeine intoxication .
people suffering from psychosis are described as psychotic .
approximately three percent of people who are suffering from alcoholism experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal .
people with psychosis may have one or more of the following : hallucinations , delusions , catatonia , or a thought disorder , as described below .
risk factors include : poverty , malnutrition , deforestation and urbanization .
about 200 million people in asia , africa , south and central america and southern europe live in areas where the disease is common .
the treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired , the species of leishmania and the type of infection .
amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different tissues , depending in part on which leishmania species is involved ( 4 ) .
some possible medications used for visceral disease include : liposomal amphotericin b , a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin , and miltefosine .
leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide .
infections in humans are caused by more than 20 species of leishmania .
which can transmit the infection leishmania .
leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies .
the world health organization has obtained discounts on some medications to treat the disease .
the genomes of three leishmania species ( l. major , l. infantum , and l. braziliensis ) have been sequenced and this has provided much information about the biology of the parasite .
for example , in leishmania , protein-coding genes are understood to be organized as large polycistronic units in a head-to-head or tail-to-tail manner ; rna polymerase ii transcribes long polycistronic messages in the absence of defined rna pol ii promoters , and leishmania has unique features with respect to the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in the environment .
other measures include : spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating people with the disease early to prevent further spread .
leishmaniasis \/ ˌliːʃməˈnaɪəsɪs \/ or leishmaniosis ( \/ liːʃˌmeɪnɪˈoʊsɪs \/ or \/ liːʃˌmænɪˈoʊsɪs \/ ) is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus leishmania and spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies .
additionally visceral disease can be diagnosed via blood tests .

gene targeting can be permanent or conditional .
after cells with the correct insertion have been selected , they can be used to contribute to a mouse 's tissue via embryo injection .
syphilis can not be contracted through toilet seats , daily activities , hot tubs , or sharing eating utensils or clothing .
many people who present with secondary syphilis ( 40-85 % of women , 20-65 % of men ) do not report previously having had the classic chancre of primary syphilis .
syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the spirochete bacterium treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum .
while secondary disease is known for the many different ways it can manifest , symptoms most commonly involve the skin , mucous membranes , and lymph nodes .
people with tertiary syphilis are not infectious .
there may be a symmetrical , reddish-pink , non-itchy rash on the trunk and extremities , including the palms and soles .
without treatment , a third of infected people develop tertiary disease .
if allergic , as in the case of early disease , doxycycline or tetracycline may be used , albeit for a longer duration .
early latent syphilis may have a relapse of symptoms .
other late presentations may be treated with once-weekly intramuscular penicillin g for three weeks .
the first-choice treatment for uncomplicated syphilis remains a single dose of intramuscular penicillin g or a single dose of oral azithromycin .
most ( 60 % ) of new cases in the united states occur in men who have sex with men .
primary syphilis is typically acquired by direct sexual contact with the infectious lesions of another person .
also , there may be argyll robertson pupils , which are bilateral small pupils that constrict when the person focuses on near objects , but do not constrict when exposed to bright light .
approximately 30 to 60 % of those exposed to primary or secondary syphilis will get the disease .
neurosyphilis refers to an infection involving the central nervous system .
syphilis is transmitted primarily by sexual contact or during pregnancy from a mother to her fetus ; the spirochaete is able to pass through intact mucous membranes or compromised skin .
late latent syphilis is asymptomatic , and not as contagious as early latent syphilis .
the united kingdom uses a cut-off of two years for early and late latent syphilis .
the signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents ( primary , secondary , latent , and tertiary ) .
marulanda died of a heart attack on march 26 , 2008 .
he is first mentioned ( though not seen ) in planet of the spiders , when the brigadier thinks the third doctor has gone into a coma .
during a 1975 benefit concert , he collapsed on stage from a heart attack and subsequently fell into a coma that persisted for nearly nine years until his death in 1984 , at the age of 49 .
the cause of death was not reported initially , but it is mentioned that baraka had a long struggle with diabetes .
in 1796 , a catholic priest insisted that pato players who died in such a way should be denied christian burial .
since then , several other high-resolution structures have been determined by electron crystallography , including the light-harvesting complex , the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor , and the bacterial flagellum .
he died of a heart attack in 1967 .
pauling was one of the founders of the fields of quantum chemistry and molecular biology .
widespread private concerns related to penis size have led to a number of folklore sayings and popular culture reflections related to penis size .
the perception of having a large penis is often linked to higher self-esteem .
a study undertaken at utrecht university found that the majority of homosexual men in the study regarded a large penis as ideal , and having one was linked to self-esteem .
an adult penis with an erect length of less than 7 cm ( just under 3 inches ) , but otherwise formed normally , is referred to in medicine as a micropenis .
males may quite easily underestimate the size of their own penis relative to that of others , and many men who believe that their penis is of inadequate size have average-sized penises .
flaccid penis length is a poor estimate of erect length .
the most accurate measurement of the human penis comes from several measurements at different times since there is natural minor variability in size due to arousal level , time of day , room temperature , frequency of sexual activity , and reliability of measurement .
in 1995 , at the age of nineteen , perales was diagnosed with neuropathy and lost the use of her legs within three months .
williams suggested that some genes responsible for increased fitness in the younger , fertile organism contribute to decreased fitness later in life .
this is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables , bread , pasta , grains and sugar , while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts , cream and butter .
it consists of cutting or scraping away most of the connections to and from the prefrontal cortex , the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain .

as a child he battled rheumatic fever , hepatitis and poliomyelitis .
child development refers to the biological , psychological and emotional changes that occur in human beings between birth and the end of adolescence , as the individual progresses from dependency to increasing autonomy .
after years of illness , balanchine died on april 30 , 1983 , aged 79 , in manhattan from creutzfeldt-jakob disease , which was diagnosed only after his death .
a disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people ; it must also be infectious .
for instance , cancer is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious or contagious .
a pandemic ( from greek πᾶν pan `` all '' and δῆμος demos `` people '' ) is an epidemic of infectious disease that has spread through human populations across a large region ; for instance multiple continents , or even worldwide .
typically , belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals , with dinner being the largest meal of the day .
wheat and rye breads are consumed in belarus , but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat .
an american society of the order of st. john was established in 1957 as a foundation to assist the order with charitable work , after 1961 focusing its efforts specifically on the st. john ophthalmic hospital in jerusalem and some other organizations aiding the sick .
black pepper ( or perhaps long pepper ) was believed to cure illness such as constipation , diarrhea , earache , gangrene , heart disease , hernia , hoarseness , indigestion , insect bites , insomnia , joint pain , liver problems , lung disease , oral abscesses , sunburn , tooth decay , and toothaches .
also , it is eliminated from the diet of patients having abdominal surgery and ulcers because of its irritating effect upon the intestines , being replaced by what is referred to as a bland diet .
the oldest , christian , died in a boating accident in 1934 , and another , harald , died from childhood meningitis .
pavlovian conditioning was a major theme in aldous huxley 's dystopian novel , brave new world , and also to a large degree in thomas pynchon 's gravity 's rainbow .
pavlov 's research on conditional reflexes greatly influenced not only science , but also popular culture .
pavlov investigated the gastric function of dogs , and later children , by externalizing a salivary gland so he could collect , measure , and analyze the saliva and what response it had to food under different conditions .
as pavlov 's work became known in the west , particularly through the writings of john b. watson , the idea of `` conditioning '' as an automatic form of learning became a key concept in the developing specialism of comparative psychology , and the general approach to psychology that underlay it , behaviorism .
littman tentatively attributed the popular imagery to pavlov 's contemporaries vladimir mikhailovich bekhterev and john b. watson , until thomas found several references that unambiguously stated pavlov did , indeed , use a bell .
it is less widely known that pavlov 's experiments on the conditional reflex extended to children , some of whom underwent surgical procedures , similar to those performed on the dogs , for the collection of saliva .
the concept for which pavlov is famous is the `` conditioned reflex '' ( or in his own words the conditional reflex : the translation of условный рефлекс into english is debatable ) he developed jointly with his assistant ivan filippovitch tolochinov in 1901 .
alongside melanie klein , she may be considered the founder of psychoanalytic child psychology : as her father put it , child analysis ` had received a powerful impetus through `` the work of frau melanie klein and of my daughter , anna freud '' ' .
during the 1970s she was concerned with the problems of emotionally deprived and socially disadvantaged children , and she studied deviations and delays in development .
wernicke 's area , which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes , plays a key role ( in tandem with broca 's area in the frontal lobe ) in speech comprehension .
the temporal lobe is located beneath the lateral fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain .
the left temporal lobe holds the primary auditory cortex , which is important for the processing of semantics in both speech and vision in humans .
mcqueen died at age 84 on december 22 , 1995 at augusta regional medical center in augusta , from burns sustained when a kerosene heater she attempted to light malfunctioned and burst into flames .
by may 1904 , chekhov was terminally ill with tuberculosis .
there is a visual cortex in each hemisphere of the brain .
research on the primary visual cortex can involve recording action potentials from electrodes within the brain of cats , ferrets , rats , mice , or monkeys , or through recording intrinsic optical signals from animals or eeg , meg , or fmri signals from human and monkey v1 .
it is located in the occipital lobe , in the back of the brain .
the left hemisphere visual cortex receives signals from the right visual field and the right visual cortex from the left visual field .
the red crescent society has helped millions of pakistanis overcome disease and disaster , by offering support services for pakistanis , which include , food , clean water , and medical services .
the exact cause of sarcopenia is unknown , but it may be due to a combination of the gradual failure in the `` satellite cells '' which help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibers , and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of critical secreted growth factors which are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival .
muscular atrophy increases the risks of falling in conditions such as ibm ( inclusion body myositis ) .
muscle atrophy results from a co-morbidity of several common diseases , including cancer , aids , congestive heart failure , copd ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) , renal failure , and severe burns ; patients who have `` cachexia '' in these disease settings have a poor prognosis .
muscular atrophy affects a major number of elderly .
lemkin died of a heart attack at the public relations office of milton h. blow in new york city in 1959 , at the age of 59 .
in the human male , the urethra is about 8 inches ( 20 cm ) long and opens at the end of the penis .
in anatomy , the urethra ( from greek οὐρήθρα - ourethra ) is a tube that connects the urinary bladder to the genitals for the removal of fluids from the body .
the female urethra is about 4 cm in length .
the external urethral sphincter is a striated muscle that allows voluntary control over urination .
after 6-12 h , severe hyperkalemia , also the result of muscle breakdown , can lead to cardiac arrest .
after 3-8 h , myoglobin , as a result of muscle breakdown , may start to show up in the blood plasma , which can cause the urine to turn a dark reddish , brown , or black color , and eventually lead to acute renal failure .
the event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old manon gropius , the daughter of alma mahler ( once gustav mahler 's wife ) and walter gropius .
in humans , the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black , depending on the concentration of melanin in the iris pigment epithelium ( located on the back of the iris ) , the melanin content within the iris stroma ( located at the front of the iris ) , and the cellular density of the stroma .
eye color or eye color is a polygenic phenotypic character determined by two distinct factors : the pigmentation of the eye 's iris and the frequency-dependence of the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris .
hazel eyes are due to a combination of rayleigh scattering and a moderate amount of melanin in the iris ' anterior border layer .
heterochromia of the eye ( heterochromia iridis or heterochromia iridum ; the common incorrect form `` heterochromia iridium '' is not correct latin ) is of two kinds .
he is a co-founder of the biotech start-up companies biogen and myriad genetics , and was the first chairman on their respective boards of directors .

after jerilderie , hart went into hiding with the gang and , for most of 1879 , the gang remained shadowy and elusive figures although hart did appear at a st. kilda doctor 's surgery to be treated for a foot condition .
a patient who has such an illness may be referred to as a terminal patient , terminally ill or simply terminal .
palliative care is normally offered to terminally ill patients , regardless of their overall disease management style , if it seems likely to help manage symptoms such as pain and improve quality of life .
terminal illness is a medical term commonly used to refer to a disease that will result in the death of the patient regardless of any treatment intervention .
avian influenza - known informally as avian flu or bird flu - refers to `` influenza caused by viruses adapted to birds . ''
later outbreaks of bubonic plague in italy include the city of florence in 1630-33 and the areas surrounding naples , rome and genoa in 1656-57 .
the papal city of bologna lost an estimated 15,000 citizens to the plague , with neighboring smaller cities of modena and parma also being heavily affected .
german and french troops carried the plague to the city of mantua in 1629 , as a result of troop movements associated with the thirty years ' war ( 1618-48 ) .
this outbreak of plague also spread north into tyrol , an alpine region of western austria and northern italy .
venetian troops , infected with the disease , retreated into northern and central italy , spreading the infection .
in october 1629 , the plague reached milan , lombardy 's major commercial center .
the italian plague of 1629-31 was a series of outbreaks of bubonic plague which occurred from 1629 through 1631 in northern italy .
this episode is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long pandemic of bubonic plague which began with the black death .
this epidemic , often referred to as great plague of milan , claimed the lives of approximately 280,000 people , with the cities of the lombardy and veneto regions experiencing particularly high death rates .
bvi is an application that can be used on a 3d full body scanner to determine individual health risk , whether the scanning hardware uses visible light optical information or otherwise .
the body volume index ( bvi ) is a new measurement for obesity , proposed as an alternative to the body mass index ( bmi ) .
a number of medications are useful for preventing further episodes of gout , including xanthine oxidase inhibitor ( including allopurinol and febuxostat ) and uricosurics ( including probenecid and sulfinpyrazone ) .
other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count , electrolytes , renal function , and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) .
however , both the white blood cells and esr may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection .
extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion .
however , a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase the risk .
pegloticase ( krystexxa ) was approved in the usa to treat gout in 2010 .
diuretics have been associated with attacks of gout .
this should be considered in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment .
urate-lowering measures should be increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300-360 µmol \/ l ( 5.0-6 .0 mg\/dl ) , and are continued indefinitely .
other conditions that look similar include pseudogout and rheumatoid arthritis .
gout was historically known as `` the disease of kings '' or `` rich man 's disease . ''
a white blood cell count as high as 40.0 × 109\/l ( 40,000 \/ mm3 ) has been documented .
gout can present in a number of ways , although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis ( a red , tender , hot , swollen joint ) .
hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol \/ l ( 7.0 mg\/dl ) in males and 360 μmol \/ l ( 6.0 mg\/dl ) in females .
high levels of uric acid in the blood ( hyperuricemia ) is the underlying cause of gout .
a definitive diagnosis of gout is based upon the identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid or a tophus .
about 10 % of people with hyperuricemia develop gout at some point in their lifetimes .
the immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout , the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide .
hyperuricemia is a classic feature of gout , but it occurs nearly half of the time without hyperuricemia , and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout .
other medicines that increase the risk include niacin and aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) .
other conditions commonly complicated by gout include : polycythemia , lead poisoning , renal failure , hemolytic anemia , psoriasis , and solid organ transplants .
they are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout , unless destructive joint changes , tophi , or urate nephropathy exist , as medications have not been found cost-effective until this point .
three genes called slc2a9 , slc22a12 and abcg2 have been found commonly to be associated with gout , and variations in them can approximately double the risk .
long-standing elevated uric acid levels ( hyperuricemia ) may result in other symptomatology , including hard , painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi .
the increase is believed due to increasing risk factors in the population , such as metabolic syndrome , longer life expectancy and changes in diet .
xanthine oxidase inhibitors ( including allopurinol and febuxostat ) block uric acid production , and long-term therapy is safe and well tolerated , and can be used in people with renal impairment or urate stones , although allopurinol has caused hypersensitivity in a small number of individuals .
the most important differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis .
however , it may also present as tophi , kidney stones , or urate nephropathy .
gout ( also known as podagra when it involves the big toe ) is a medical condition usually characterized by recurrent attacks of acute inflammatory arthritis-a red , tender , hot , swollen joint .
its side effects ( primarily gastrointestinal upset ) limit its usage .
gout frequently occurs in combination with other medical problems .
gout has become more common in recent decades , affecting about 1-2 % of the western population at some point in their lives .
they also lead to improvement when injected into the joint ; a joint infection must be excluded , however , as steroids worsens this condition .
renal underexcretion of uric acid is the primary cause of hyperuricemia in about 90 % of cases , while overproduction is the cause in less than 10 % .
chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function .
a body mass index greater than or equal to 35 increases a male 's risk of gout threefold .
nsaids are the usual first-line treatment for gout , and no specific agent is significantly more or less effective than any other .
recent studies have found that other dietary factors once believed associated are , in fact , not , including the intake of purine-rich vegetables ( e.g. , beans , peas , lentils , and spinach ) and total protein .
gastrointestinal upset , however , depends on the dose , and the risk can be decreased by using a smaller yet still effective dose .
when levels are between 415 and 530 μmol \/ l ( 7 and 8.9 mg\/dl ) , the risk is 0.5 % per year , while in those with a level greater than 535 μmol \/ l ( 9 mg\/dl ) , the risk is 4.5 % per year .
uricosuric medications are typically preferred if undersecretion of uric acid , as indicated by a 24-hour collection of urine results in a uric acid amount of less than 800 mg , is found .
elevated levels of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys , resulting in stone formation and subsequent urate nephropathy .
the occurrence of gout is partly genetic , contributing to about 60 % of variability in uric acid level .

werner huttig of the nazi party 's rassenpolitisches amt ( office of racial politics ) said that a smoking mother 's breast milk contained nicotine , a claim that modern research has proven correct .
the nazi anti-tobacco campaign included banning smoking in trams , buses and city trains , promoting health education , limiting cigarette rations in the wehrmacht , organizing medical lectures for soldiers , and raising the tobacco tax .
women who smoked were considered to be vulnerable to premature aging and loss of physical attractiveness ; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a german family .
adolf hitler was a heavy smoker in his early life-he used to smoke 25 to 40 cigarettes daily-but gave up the habit , concluding that it was a waste of money .
the anti-tobacco movement did not have much effect in the early years of the nazi regime and tobacco use increased between 1933 and 1939 , but smoking by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945 .

building occupants complain of symptoms such as sensory irritation of the eyes , nose , throat ; neurotoxic or general health problems ; skin irritation ; nonspecific hypersensitivity reactions ; and odor and taste sensations .
other causes have been attributed to contaminants produced by outgassing of some types of building materials , volatile organic compounds ( voc ) , molds ( see mold health issues ) , improper exhaust ventilation of ozone ( byproduct of some office machinery ) , light industrial chemicals used within , or lack of adequate fresh-air intake\/air filtration ( see minimum efficiency reporting value ) .
there might be a gender difference in reporting rates of sick building syndrome because women tend to report more symptoms than men do .
sick building causes are frequently pinned down to flaws in the heating , ventilation , and air conditioning ( hvac ) systems .
symptoms are often dealt with after the fact by boosting the overall turn-over rate of fresh air exchange with the outside air , but the new green building design goal should be able to avoid most of the sbs problem sources in the first place , minimize the ongoing use of voc cleaning compounds , and eliminate conditions that encourage allergenic mold growth .

at the time it was generally thought that the point at which the optic nerve entered the eye should actually be the most sensitive portion of the retina ; however , mariotte 's discovery disproved this theory .
in them , the optic nerve approaches the receptors from behind , so it does not create a break in the retina .
since there are no cells to detect light on the optic disc , a part of the field of vision is not perceived .
a particular blind spot known as the blind spot , physiological blind spot , `` blind point '' , or punctum caecum in medical literature , is the place in the visual field that corresponds to the lack of light-detecting photoreceptor cells on the optic disc of the retina where the optic nerve passes through the optic disc .

further inquiry should determine whether the pain is superficial or deep - whether it occurs primarily at the vaginal outlet or vaginal barrel or upon deep thrusting against the cervix .
when the vagina is dry and undilated , thrusting of the penis is painful .
when pain occurs , the woman experiencing dyspareunia may be distracted from feeling pleasure and excitement .
for men with ic , pain occurs at the moment of ejaculation and is focused at the tip of the penis .

it is a method for influencing one 's autonomic nervous system .
autogenic training is contraindicated for people with heart conditions or psychotic disorders .
these include altered heart sounds , such as a widely split s2 or second heart sound , a loud p2 or pulmonic valve closure sound ( part of the second heart sound ) , ( para ) sternal heave , possible s3 or third heart sound , and pulmonary regurgitation .
further procedures are required to confirm the presence of pulmonary hypertension and exclude other possible diagnoses .
a swan-ganz catheter can also measure the cardiac output , which is far more important in measuring disease severity than the pulmonary arterial pressure .
the revised system developed by this group provides the current framework for understanding pulmonary hypertension .
many pathways are involved in the abnormal proliferation and contraction of the smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary arteries in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension .
this delivery system can cause sepsis and thrombosis .
a physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension .
diagnosis of pah requires the presence of pulmonary hypertension .
pulmonary hypertension can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance and heart failure .
a detailed family history is established to determine whether the disease might be familial .
a physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension , including a loud s2 ( pulmonic valve closure sound ) , ( para ) sternal heave , jugular venous distension , pedal edema , ascites , hepatojugular reflux , clubbing etc. .
these generally include pulmonary function tests ; blood tests to exclude hiv , autoimmune diseases , and liver disease ; electrocardiography ( ecg ) ; arterial blood gas measurements ; x-rays of the chest ( followed by high-resolution ct scanning if interstitial lung disease is suspected ) ; and ventilation-perfusion or v\/q scanning to exclude chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension .
because pulmonary hypertension can be of five major types , a series of tests must be performed to distinguish pulmonary arterial hypertension from venous , hypoxic , thromboembolic , or miscellaneous varieties .
a history of exposure to drugs such as cocaine , methamphetamine , alcohol leading to cirrhosis , and tobacco leading to emphysema are considered significant .
pulmonary hypertension is present when mean pulmonary artery pressure exceeds 25 mm hg ( 3300 pa ) at rest .
three of these pathways are important since they have been targeted with drugs - endothelin receptor antagonists , phosphodiesterase type 5 ( pde-5 ) inhibitors , and prostacyclin derivatives .
biopsy of the lung is usually not indicated unless the pulmonary hypertension is thought to be due to an underlying interstitial lung disease ; further , lung biopsies are fraught with risks of bleeding due to the high intrapulmonary blood pressure .
paop ( pulmonary artery occlusion pressure ) and pvr ( pulmonary vascular resistance ) can not be measured directly with echocardiography .
a second conference in 1998 at évian-les-bains also addressed the causes of secondary ph ( i.e. those due to other medical conditions ) , and in 2008 , the 4th world symposium on pulmonary arterial hypertension was convened in dana point to modify the classification based on new understandings of disease mechanisms .
in addition , the increased workload of the heart causes hypertrophy of the right ventricle , making the heart less able to pump blood through the lungs , ultimately causing right heart failure ( a condition known as cor pulmonale ) .
the dana point 2008 updated clinical classification system can be summarized as follows : whatever the initial cause , pulmonary arterial hypertension ( who group i ) involves the vasoconstriction or tightening of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs .
pulmonary hypertension ( ph ) is an increase of blood pressure in the pulmonary artery , pulmonary vein , or pulmonary capillaries , together known as the lung vasculature , leading to shortness of breath , dizziness , fainting , leg swelling and other symptoms .
this further increases the blood pressure within the lungs and impairs their blood flow .
pulmonary venous hypertension typically presents with shortness of breath while lying flat or sleeping ( orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ) , while pulmonary arterial hypertension ( pah ) typically does not .
anton-babinski syndrome is a rare symptom of brain damage occurring in the occipital lobe .
leukemia can affect people at any age .
some leukemia patients do not have high white blood cell counts visible during a regular blood count .
for example , people with down syndrome have a significantly increased risk of developing forms of acute leukemia ( especially acute myeloid leukemia ) , and fanconi anemia is a risk factor for developing acute myeloid leukemia .
warburton arrived in a starved condition and blind in one eye .
laboratory rats have also proved valuable in psychological studies of learning and other mental processes ( barnett , 2002 ) , as well as to understand group behavior and overcrowding ( with the work of john b. calhoun on behavioral sink ) .

a study published in 1997 found an inverse association between death from coronary heart disease and frequency of orgasm even given the risk that myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction can be triggered by sexual activity .
masturbation with a partner can also theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted diseases by contact with bodily fluids .
semen is valued and masturbation is seen as a waste of semen and is therefore frowned upon even though frequent ejaculation is encouraged .
in this and other tribes , the measure of manhood is actually associated more with the amount of ejaculate and his need than penis size .
in these cases , any energetic manipulation of the penis can be problematic .
a man whose penis has suffered a blunt trauma , severe bend or other injury during intercourse or masturbation may , rarely , sustain a penile fracture or suffer from peyronie 's disease .
though research is still as yet scant , those suffering from cardiovascular disorders ( particularly those recovering from myocardial infarction , or heart attacks ) should resume physical activity ( including sexual intercourse and masturbation ) gradually and with the frequency and rigor which their physical status will allow .
the capacity and need to ejaculate is developed or nurtured for years from an early age but through fellatio so that it can be consumed rather than wasted .
masturbation is also seen as a sexual technique that protects individuals from the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases .
the study also indicated that increased ejaculation through masturbation rather than intercourse would be more helpful as intercourse is associated with diseases ( stds ) that may increase the risk of cancer instead .
in 2003 , an australian research team led by graham giles of the cancer council australia found that males masturbating frequently had a lower probability to develop prostate cancer .
the most common male masturbation technique is simply to hold the penis with a loose fist and then to move the hand up and down the shaft .
since the germ theory of disease , cleanliness has come to mean an effort to remove germs and other hazardous materials .
although previously believed that clinically active pituitary adenomas were rare , recent studies have suggested that they may affect approximately one in 1000 of the general population .
pituitary adenomas are noncancerous tumors that occur in the pituitary gland .
pituitary adenomas represent from 10 % to 25 % of all intracranial neoplasms and the estimated prevalence rate in the general population is approximately 17 % .
pituitary adenomas are generally divided into three categories dependent upon their biological functioning : benign adenoma , invasive adenoma , or carcinomas , with carcinomas accounting for 0.1 % to 0.2 % , approximately 35 % being invasive adenomas and most being benign adenomas .
non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign in the literal as well as the clinical sense ; however a recent meta-analysis ( fernández-balsells , et al. 2011 ) of available research has shown there are to date scant studies - of poor quality - to either support or refute this assumption .
a majority of pituitary microadenomas often remain undiagnosed and those that are diagnosed are often found as an incidental finding , and are referred to as incidentalomas .
in addition , some dna polymerases also have proofreading ability ; they can remove nucleotides from the end of a growing strand in order to correct mismatched bases .
this type of color blindness is usually a sex-linked condition .
color blindness can also be produced by physical or chemical damage to the eye , the optic nerve , or parts of the brain .
two of the most common inherited forms of color blindness are protanopia , and deuteranopia .
the typical human retina contains two kinds of light cells : the rod cells ( active in low light ) and the cone cells ( active in normal daylight ) .
the english chemist john dalton published the first scientific paper on this subject in 1798 , `` extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colors '' , after the realization of his own color blindness .
because of dalton 's work , the general condition has been called daltonism , although in english this term is now used more narrowly for deuteranopia alone .
there is no actual blindness but there is a deficiency of color vision .
in individuals with northern european ancestry , as many as 8 percent of men and 0.5 percent of women experience the common form of red-green color blindness .
other forms of color blindness are much more rare .

Transposons themselves are assigned to one of two classes according to their mechanism of transposition , which can be described as either `` copy and paste '' -LRB- class I -RRB- or `` cut and paste '' -LRB- class II -RRB- .
Bacteria may undergo high rates of gene deletion as part of a mechanism to remove transposons and viruses from their genomes while eukaryotic organisms use RNA interference -LRB- RNAi -RRB- to inhibit transposon activity .
Various viruses and transposons also share features in their genome structures and biochemical abilities , leading to speculation that they share a common ancestor .
Transposons may have been co-opted by the vertebrate immune system as a means of producing antibody diversity : The V -LRB- D -RRB- J recombination system operates by a mechanism similar to that of transposons .
Transposition can create phenotypically significant mutations and alter the cell 's genome size .
Ocelli -LRB- pit-type eyes of arthropods -RRB- blur the image across the whole retina , and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field ; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush the information to the brain .
Focusing the image would also cause the sun 's image to be focused on a few receptors , with the possibility of damage under the intense light ; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity .
The resolution of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material with a higher refractive index to form a lens , which may greatly reduce the blur radius encounteredâ '' hence increasing the resolution obtainable .
The ocelli of insects bear a simple lens , but their focal point always lies behind the retina ; consequently they can never form a sharp image .
Good fliers like flies or honey bees , or prey-catching insects like praying mantis or dragonflies , have specialized zones of ommatidia organized into a fovea area which gives acute vision .
The scallop Pecten has up to 100 millimeter-scale reflector eyes fringing the edge of its shell .

Though bronze is generally harder than wrought iron , with Vickers hardness of 60 â `` 258 vs. 30 â `` 80 , the Bronze Age gave way to the Iron Age ; this happened because iron was easier to find and easier to process . Bronze was still used during the Iron Age , for example officers in the Roman army had bronze swords while foot soldiers had iron , but , for many purposes , the weaker wrought iron was found to be sufficiently strong .
In biology , a filament is a long chain of protein subunits , such as those found in hair , muscle , or in flagella .
In the 2000s , some of the active topics have been the role of gene duplication in the emergence of novel gene function , the extent of adaptive molecular evolution versus neutral drift , and the identification of molecular changes responsible for various human characteristics especially those pertaining to infection , disease , and cognition .
Some of the key topics that spurred development of the field have been the evolution of enzyme function , the use of nucleic acid divergence as a `` molecular clock '' to study species divergence , and the origin of noncoding DNA .
Molecular evolution emerged as a scientific field in the 1960s as researchers from molecular biology , evolutionary biology and population genetics sought to understand recent discoveries on the structure and function of nucleic acids and protein .

In 1877 , the order established at large railway centres and mining districts various St. John Ambulance associations , so that railway men and colliers could learn how to treat victims of accidents ; in 1882 , the Grand Priory founded a hospice and ophthalmic dispensary in Jerusalem -LRB- Known today as the St. John of Jerusalem Eye Hospital Group -RRB- ; and by 1887 , had created the St. John Ambulance Brigade , which undertook practical and life-saving work .
All Bailiffs and Dames Grand Cross may wear their badges either at the left hip on a 101.6 m -LRB- for men -RRB- or 82.5 m -LRB- for women -RRB- wide , black watered silk ribbon over the right shoulder or from a 16.5 m wide black band at the collar .
The issue of the order 's Christian character and the issue of `` inclusive membership '' was dealt with in the Grand Council 's Pro Fide Report in 2005 , wherein it was said that the order 's life is shaped by Christian faith and values , but that '' -LRB- r -RRB- ather than the emphasis being primarily upon ` spiritual beliefs or doctrine ' it is on works of mercy rendered through St. John '' ; therefore , while the Great Officers are required to profess the Christian faith , the same is `` not an essential condition of membership '' and '' -LRB- t -RRB- he onus is on the man or woman who is invited to the privilege of membership to decide whether he or she can with a good conscience promise to be faithful to the stated aims and purposes of this Christian lay order of chivalry . ''
Male Knights Justice or Grace must carry their badges on a 16.5 mm wide ribbon at the neck , and Commanders , Officers , and Members have theirs on a 38 m straight ribbon suspended from a medal bar on the left breast , while females in all grades may wear their insignia either on a ribbon bow pinned at the left shoulder or hung from a medal bar in the men 's fashion , depending on the circumstance and clothing worn .

Thymol , an antiseptic , is the main active ingredient in Listerine mouthwash .
Its oxytocin-like effect causes uterine contractions and more rapid delivery of the placenta , but this was said by Sheila Kitzinger to cause an increased prevalence of retained placenta .
Because it is antiseptic , thyme boiled in water and cooled is very effective against inflammation of the throat when gargled 3 times a day .
Medicinally thyme is used for respiratory infections in the form of a tincture , tisane , salve , syrup or by steam inhalation .
The pollen tube of most seed plants acts as a conduit to transport sperm cells from the pollen grain , either from the stigma -LRB- in flowering plants or angiosperms -RRB- to the ovules at the base of the pistil , or directly through ovule tissue in some gymnosperms -LRB- conifers and gnetophytes -RRB- .
In angiosperms the pollen tube germinates from the pollen grain and grows the entire length through the stigma , style , ovary and ovules to reach the eggs .
In other gymnosperms -LRB- Ginkgo and cycads -RRB- the pollen tube is involved only in nutrient uptake from ovule tissue by the pollen grain , and does not convey sperm cells to the egg .
The endosperm is rich in starch , proteins and oils and is a major source of human food -LRB- e.g. , wheat , barley , rye , oats , corn -RRB-
If the animal is allowed to survive after spinning its cocoon and through the pupa phase of its life cycle , it will release proteolytic enzymes to make a hole in the cocoon so that it can emerge as a moth .
The size of the eyes and the sclerotic rings suggests that Ophthalmosaurus hunted at a depth where there is not much light or that it may have hunted at night when a prey species was more active .
The eyes occupied almost all of the space in the skull and were protected by bony plates -LRB- sclerotic rings -RRB- , which most likely assisted to maintain the shape of the eyeballs against water pressure at depth .
To make the chocolate drink , which was served cold , the Maya ground cocoa seeds into a paste , and mixed it with water , cornmeal , chile peppers , and other ingredients .
By using cocoa powder and low amounts of cocoa butter , bar chocolate was then possible to manufacture .
Hot chocolate of this type is commonly sold in circular or hexagonal tablets which can be dissolved into hot milk , water or cream , then blended until the mixture develops a creamy froth .
In the United Kingdom , `` hot chocolate '' is a sweet chocolate drink made with hot milk or water , and powder containing chocolate , sugar , and powdered milk .
Americans use the terms `` hot chocolate '' and `` hot cocoa '' interchangeably . In other places , a distinction is made between `` hot cocoa '' , made from powder made by removing most of the rich cocoa butter from the ground cacao beans , and `` hot chocolate '' , made directly from bar chocolate , which already contains cocoa , sugar and cocoa butter .
This powderâ '' much like the instant cocoa powder used todayâ '' was easier to stir into milk and water , and led to another very important discovery : solid chocolate .
The first chocolate beverage is believed to have been created by the Mayan peoples around 2,000 years ago , and a cocoa beverage was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD .
What the Spaniards then called `` chocolatl '' was said to be a beverage consisting of a chocolate base flavored with vanilla and other spices that was served cold .
Thus the major difference between the two is the cocoa butter , whose absence makes hot cocoa significantly lower in fat than hot chocolate , while still preserving all the antioxidants found in chocolate .
In other places , a distinction is made between `` hot cocoa '' , made from powder made by removing most of the rich cocoa butter from the ground cacao beans , and `` hot chocolate '' , made directly from bar chocolate , which already contains cocoa , sugar and cocoa butter .
It is very sweet and may be topped with marshmallows , whipped cream , or a piece of solid chocolate .
After defeating Montezuma 's warriors , and demanding that the Aztec nobles hand over their valuables , CortÃ s returned to Spain in 1528 , bringing cocoa beans and chocolate drink making equipment .
By using cocoa powder and low amounts of cocoa butter , bar chocolate was then possible to manufacture . The term `` chocolate '' then came to mean solid chocolate , rather than hot chocolate .
It was often seasoned with vanilla , chile pepper , and achiote , and was believed to fight fatigue , which is probably attributable to the theobromine content , a mood enhancer .
American instant hot cocoa powder often includes powdered milk or other dairy ingredients so it can be made without using milk .
Because sugar was yet to come to the Americas , xocolatl was said to be an acquired taste .
The explorer Francisco HernÃ ndez wrote that chocolate beverages helped treat fever and liver disease .
`` Cocoa '' usually refers to a similar drink made with just hot milk and cocoa powder , then sweetened to taste with sugar .
When chocolate was introduced to the French in the 17th century , it was reportedly used `` to fight against fits of anger and bad moods '' , which may be attributed to chocolate 's phenylethylamine content .
Another explorer , Santiago de Valverde Turices , believed that large amounts of hot chocolate was helpful in treating chest ailments , but in smaller amounts could help stomach disorders .
Besides the instant powder form , traditional Mexican hot chocolate includes semi-sweet chocolate , cinnamon , sugar and vanilla .
Hot chocolate -LRB- also known as hot cocoa or just cocoa -RRB- is a heated beverage typically consisting of shaved chocolate , melted chocolate or cocoa powder , heated milk or water , and sugar .
Spontaneous abortion -LRB- also known as miscarriage -RRB- is the expulsion of an embryo or fetus due to accidental trauma or natural causes before approximately the 22nd week of gestation ; the definition by gestational age varies by country .
Inconsistent use was reported by 49 % of those using condoms and 76 % of those using the combined oral contraceptive pill ; 42 % of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage .
A spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma ; intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion or feticide .
Hydrogen cyanide is produced when a solution containing a labile cyanide is acidified because HCN is a weak acid ; alkaline solutions are safer to use because they do not evolve hydrogen cyanide .
In May 2010 the Governor declared a state of emergency because of foot and mouth disease .

Many other dromaeosaurid fossils have been found with feathers covering their bodies , some with fully-developed feathered wings .
It has been proposed that this tail was used as a stabilizer and\/or counterweight while running or in the air ; in Microraptor , an elongate diamond-shaped fan of feathers is preserved on the end of the tail .
Both the first and second toes on each foot of B. bondoc were also held retracted and bore enlarged , sickle-shaped claws .
Other fossils , which do not preserve actual impressions of feathers , still preserve the associated bumps on the forearm bones where long wing feathers would have attached in life .
The seriema also has an enlarged second toe claw , and uses it to tear apart small prey items for swallowing .
A 2005 study by Sankar Chatterjee suggested that the wings of Microraptor functioned like a split-level `` biplane '' , and that it likely employed a phugoid style of gliding , in which it would launch from a perch and swoop downward in a ` U ' shaped curve , then lift again to land on another tree , with the tail and hind wings helping to control its position and speed .
There is a large web of skin between the hind legs -LRB- the uropatagium -RRB- which may assist in flying and catching insects , although there are no tail bones or calcars to help control it in flight .
Carbonation is the process of dissolving carbon dioxide in water .

Bunyan presents a decrepit and harmless giant to confront Christian at the end of the Valley of the Shadow of Death that is explicitly named `` Pope '' : Now I saw in my Dream , that at the end of this Valley lay blood , bones , ashes , and mangled bodies of men , even of Pilgrims that had gone this way formerly : And while I was musing what should be the reason , I espied a little before me a Cave , where two Giants , Pope and Pagan , dwelt in old times , by whose Power and Tyranny the Men whose bones , blood ashes , & c. lay there , were cruelly put to death .
But by this place Christian went without much danger , whereat I somewhat wondered ; but I have learned since , that Pagan has been dead many a day ; and as for the other , though he be yet alive , he is by reason of age , and also of the many shrewd brushes that he met with in his younger dayes , grown so crazy and stiff in his joynts , that he can now do little more than sit in his Caves mouth , grinning at Pilgrims as they go by , and biting his nails , because he can not come at them .
Anna Fitzgerald 's older sister , Kate , suffers from acute promyelocytic leukemia , a cancer of the blood and bone marrow .
Following maturation , the lymphocytes enter the circulation and peripheral lymphoid organs -LRB- e.g. the spleen and lymph nodes -RRB- where they survey for invading pathogens and\/or tumor cells .
B cells mature into B lymphocytes in the bone marrow , while T cells migrate to and mature in a distinct organ , called the thymus .
The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific â non-self â antigens , during a process known as antigen presentation .
In response to pathogens some T cells , called T helper cells , produce cytokines that direct the immune response while other T cells , called cytotoxic T cells , produce toxic granules that contain powerful enzymes which induce the death of pathogen infected cells . Following activation , B cells and T cells leave a lasting legacy of the antigens they have encountered , in the form of memory cells .
Effector lymphocytes function to eliminate the antigen , either by releasing antibodies -LRB- in the case of B cells -RRB- , cytotoxic granules -LRB- cytotoxic T cells -RRB- or by signaling to other cells of the immune system -LRB- helper T cells -RRB- .
In response to pathogens some T cells , called T helper cells , produce cytokines that direct the immune response while other T cells , called cytotoxic T cells , produce toxic granules that contain powerful enzymes which induce the death of pathogen infected cells .
Examples include storage polysaccharides such as starch and glycogen , and structural polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitin .
They can be digested by hydrolysis , catalyzed by enzymes called amylases , which can break the alpha-linkages -LRB- glycosidic bonds -RRB- .
Certain animals can digest cellulose , because bacteria possessing the enzyme are present in their gut .
Humans and many other animals lack an enzyme to break the beta-linkages , so they do not digest cellulose .
Humans and other animals have amylases , so they can digest starches .

When the adaptive immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus , it produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and render it non-infectious .
; RNA viruses : Replication usually takes place in the cytoplasm .
The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection , whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past .
; DNA viruses : The genome replication of most DNA viruses takes place in the cell 's nucleus .
An enormous variety of genomic structures can be seen among viral species ; as a group they contain more structural genomic diversity than plants , animals , archaea , or bacteria .
Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes .
They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme , e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine .
Its role in immunity is complex ; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbors .
Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell 's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery , and RNA processing machinery ; however , viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves .
In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell 's nuclear membrane to access this machinery , while in bacteria it need only enter the cell .
IgG antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out .
These persistent viruses evade immune control by sequestration , blockade of antigen presentation , cytokine resistance , evasion of natural killer cell activities , escape from apoptosis , and antigenic shift .
The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear : some may have evolved from plasmids â `` pieces of DNA that can move between cells â `` while others may have evolved from bacteria .
However , some viruses including those causing AIDS and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections .
Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time , and interest in this approach is increasing , because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria .

Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes -LRB- retroviruses -RRB- , use a DNA intermediate to replicate , whereas those with DNA genomes -LRB- pararetroviruses -RRB- use an RNA intermediate during genome replication .
In evolution , viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer , which increases genetic diversity .
A second defense of vertebrates against viruses is called cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells .
A biochemical pathway called the RISC complex is activated , which degrades the viral mRNA and the cell survives the infection .
Antibiotics have no effect on viruses , but several antiviral drugs have been developed .
When such a virus infects a cell , it releases its RNA molecule or molecules , which immediately bind to a protein complex called dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces .
Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines , which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection .

Traditionally , chlorine dioxide for disinfection applications has been made by one of three methods using sodium chlorite or the sodium chlorite - hypochlorite method :
A much smaller but important market for chlorine dioxide is for use as a disinfectant . Since 1999 a growing proportion of the chlorine dioxide made globally for water treatment and other small scale applications has been made using the chlorate , hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid method which can produce a chlorine free product at high efficiency .
All three sodium chlorite chemistries can produce chlorine dioxide with high chlorite conversion yield , but unlike the other processes the chlorite-HCl method produces completely chlorine free chlorine dioxide but suffers from the requirement of 25 % more chlorite to produce an equivalent amount of chlorine dioxide .

For eyebrows , the cycle is completed in around 4 months , while it takes the scalp 3 -- 4 years to finish ; this is the reason eyebrow hairs have a much shorter length limit compared to hairs on the head .
Hair grows in cycles of various phases : anagen is the growth phase ; catagen is the involuting or regressing phase ; and telogen , the resting or quiescent phase .
The hair matrix epithelium is one of the fastest growing cell populations in the human body , which is why some forms of chemotherapy that kill dividing cells or radiotherapy may lead to temporary hair loss .
Fifty to one-hundred club hairs are shed daily from a normal scalp .
Other structures associated with the hair follicle include arrector pili muscles , sebaceous glands and apocrine sweat glands .
Growth cycles are controlled by a chemical signal like epidermal growth factor .
Also attached to the follicle is a tiny bundle of muscle fiber called the arrector pili .
The internal root sheath is composed of three layers , Henle 's layer , Huxley 's layer , and an internal cuticle that is continuous with the outermost layer of the hair fiber .
In utero , the epithelium and underlying mesenchyma interact to form hair follicles .
It houses several types of stem cells , which supply the entire hair follicle with new cells , and take part in healing the epidermis after a wound .
Scalp hair stays in this active phase of growth for 2 â `` 7 years .
The external root sheath appears empty with cuboid cells when stained with H&E stain .
The bulge is located in the outer root sheath at the insertion point of the arrector pili muscle .
Cell division in the hair matrix produces the cells that will form the major structures of the hair fiber and the inner root sheath .
This muscle is responsible for causing the follicle lissis to become more perpendicular to the surface of the skin , and causing the follicle to protrude slightly above the surrounding skin -LRB- piloerection -RRB- and a pore encased with skin oil .
Hair follicle receptors sense the position of the hairs .
Around the papilla is the hair matrix , a collection of epithelial cells often interspersed with the pigment producing cells , melanocytes .
Stem cells are located at the junction of the erector and the follicle , and are principally responsible for the ongoing hair production during a process known as the Anagen stage .
The papilla is made up mainly of connective tissue and a capillary loop .
It signals the end of the active growth of a hair .
The papilla is usually ovoid or pear shaped with the matrix wrapped completely around it except for a short stalk-like connection to the surrounding connective tissue that provides access for the capillary .
Attached to the follicle is a sebaceous gland . This is a tiny sebum-producing gland found everywhere except on the palms , lips and soles of the feet .
Anagen is the active growth phase of hair follicles .
In human anatomy , the trapezius is a large superficial muscle that extends longitudinally from the occipital bone to the lower thoracic vertebrae and laterally to the spine of the scapula -LRB- shoulder blade -RRB- .

A cold , sweet drink made of ground oats and milk is a popular refreshment throughout Latin America .
They have a lower summer heat requirement and greater tolerance of rain than other cereals , such as wheat , rye or barley , so are particularly important in areas with cool , wet summers , such as Northwest Europe ; they are even being grown successfully in Iceland .
Oats , like rye , are usually considered a secondary crop , i.e. , derived from a weed of the primary cereal domesticates wheat and barley .
Oat protein is nearly equivalent in quality to soy protein , which has been shown by the World Health Organization to be equal to meat , milk , and egg protein .
When they reach temperatures above 300 Â C , sulfuric acid begins to decompose into sulfur trioxide and water , both in the gas phase . Sulfur trioxide is highly reactive and dissociates into sulfur dioxide and atomic oxygen , which oxidizes traces of carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide .
Some examples of mechanical systems include the flow of a liquid under pressure , the fracture of a solid from an applied force , or the vibration of an ear in response to sound .
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma presents a special challenge to oncologists , as about 70 % of patients with renal cell carcinoma develop metastases during the course of their disease , and 5 year survival for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma is between 5-15 % , though it is much improved if metastatectomy and nephrectomy to remove all visible disease is performed .
Recently , targeted therapies including torisel , nexavar , sutent , and bevacizumab have been developed , and all are now approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma .

Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming , antibiotics have been used to fight bacterial diseases .
This is an example of what is known as an evolutionary arms race , in which bacteria continue to develop strains that are less susceptible to antibiotics , while medical researchers continue to develop new antibiotics that can kill them .
A similar situation occurs with pesticide resistance in plants and insects .
If the exposure to antibiotics is short , these individuals will survive the treatment .
When exposed to antibiotics , most bacteria die quickly , but some may have mutations that make them slightly less susceptible .

Avian influenza virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam , increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains .
These strains , which include genes derived by reassortment from human , swine and avian viruses , have become a major cause of swine influenza in North America .
These H5N1 infections may be quite common : in a survey of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in West Java , where avian flu had broken out , five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus .
Influenza B has not been reported in pigs . Within influenza A and influenza C , the strains found in pigs and humans are largely distinct , although because of reassortment there have been transfers of genes among strains crossing swine , avian , and human species boundaries .
Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus , the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests that current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses .
; Prevention of human to human transmission Influenza spreads between humans when infected people cough or sneeze , then other people breathe in the virus or touch something with the virus on it and then touch their own face . `` Avoid touching your eyes , nose or mouth .
Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined , only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines .
Swine influenza , also called pig influenza , swine flu , hog flu and pig flu , is an infection by any one of several types of swine influenza virus .
Because these symptoms are not specific to swine flu , a differential diagnosis of probable swine flu requires not only symptoms but also a high likelihood of swine flu due to the person 's recent history . For example , during the 2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States , CDC advised physicians to `` consider swine influenza infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute febrile respiratory illness who have either been in contact with persons with confirmed swine flu , or who were in one of the five U.S. states that have reported swine flu cases or in Mexico during the 7 days preceding their illness onset . ''

Although gharials have sacrificed the great mechanical strength of the robust skull and jaw that most crocodiles and alligators have , and in consequence can not prey on large creatures , the reduced weight and water resistance of their lighter skull and very narrow jaw gives gharials the ability to catch rapidly moving fish , using a side-to-side snapping motion .
These teeth are not received into interdental pits ; the first , second , and third mandibular teeth fit into notches in the upper jaw .
The gharial 's snout is narrow and long , with a dilation at the end and its nasal bones are comparatively short and are widely separated from the pre-maxillaries .
Their snout morphology is ideally suited for preying on fish . Their long , narrow snouts offer very little resistance to water in swiping motions to snap up fish in the water .
Gharials have a strong crest on the outer edge of the forearm , leg , and foot .
The gharial 's lower anterior margin of orbit -LRB- jugal -RRB- is raised and its mandibular symphysis is extremely long , extending to the 23rd or 24th tooth .
During swallowing , the backward motion of the tongue forces the epiglottis over the glottis ' opening to prevent swallowed material from entering the larynx which leads to the lungs ; the larynx is also pulled upwards to assist this process .

Stimulation of the larynx by ingested matter produces a strong cough reflex to protect the lungs .
Some symptoms are hoarseness , loss of voice , pain in the throat or ears , and breathing difficulties .
Other forms of diabetes mellitus include congenital diabetes , which is due to genetic defects of insulin secretion , cystic fibrosis-related diabetes , steroid diabetes induced by high doses of glucocorticoids , and several forms of monogenic diabetes .
Insulin is released into the blood by beta cells -LRB- Î - cells -RRB- , found in the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas , in response to rising levels of blood glucose , typically after eating . Insulin is used by about two-thirds of the body 's cells to absorb glucose from the blood for use as fuel , for conversion to other needed molecules , or for storage .
Some cases of diabetes are caused by the body 's tissue receptors not responding to insulin -LRB- even when insulin levels are normal , which is what separates it from type 2 diabetes -RRB- ; this form is very uncommon .
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance which may be combined with relatively reduced insulin secretion . The defective responsiveness of body tissues to insulin is believed to involve the insulin receptor .

Asiatic cheetah -LRB- Acinonyx jubatus venaticus -RRB- has for a long time been theoretically classified as a sub-species of the cheetah with the suffix `` venaticus '' applied at the end of its scientific binomial name Acinonyx jubatus but at a Cheetah reintroduction workshop organized in India on 9 September 2009 Stephen J. O'Brien from Laboratory of Genomic Diversity of National Cancer Institute , USA who has in the past conducted numerous prestigious genetic studies including those on Asiatic lions said that according to latest modern genetic studies which became possible only now it was discovered that in fact Asiatic cheetah was genetically identical to the African Cheetah with which it had separated only about 5000 years ago which was not enough time for a sub-species level differentiation , in comparison he said that the Asian and African lion subspecies were separated some 100,000 years ago , so was the African and Asian leopard subspecies 169,000 years ago . Cheetah expert Laurie Marker of the Cheetah Conservation Fund -LRB- CCF -RRB- and other wildlife experts assembled for the occasion advised the Indian Government that for reintroduction purposes India should source the Cheetah from Africa where they were much more numerous instead of trying to have some removed from the critically endangered low population of about worlds last 70 to 100 or so Asiatic Cheetahs left in Iran .

The name Tachyglossus means `` quick tongue '' , in reference to the speed with which the Echidna uses its tongue to catch ants and termites , and aculeatus means `` spiny '' or `` equipped with spines '' .
The nostrils and the mouth are at the distal end of the snout ; the mouth of the Short-beaked Echidna can not open wider than 5 m. The body of the Short-beaked Echidna is , with the exception of the underside , face and legs , covered with cream-coloured spines .
The tongue of the Short-beaked Echidna is the animal 's sole means of catching prey , and can protrude up to 180 m outside the snout .
The embryo develops an `` egg tooth '' during incubation , which it uses to tear open the egg ; the tooth disappears soon after hatching .
By contraction of various parts of the panniculus carnosus , the Short-beaked Echidna can change shape , the most characteristic shape change being achieved by rolling itself into a ball when threatened , so protecting its belly and presenting a defensive array of sharp spines .
When the tongue is retracted , the prey is caught on backward-facing keratinous `` teeth '' , located along the roof of the buccal cavity , allowing the animal both to capture and grind food .
Protrusion of the tongue is achieved by contracting circular muscles that change the shape of the tongue and force it forwards and contracting two genioglossal muscles attached to the caudal end of the tongue and to the mandible .
It has a highly sensitive optic nerve , and has been shown to have visual discrimination and spatial memory comparable to those of a rat .
Insulation is provided by fur between the spines , which ranges in color from honey to a dark reddish-brown and even black ; the underside and short tail are also covered in fur .
Another story tells of a greedy man who kept food from his tribe ; warriors speared him and he crawled away into the bushes , where he turned into an Echidna , the spears becoming his spines .

Because of Dalton 's work , the condition was often called daltonism , although this term is now used for a type of color blindness called deuteranopia .
Many of the genes involved in color vision are on the X chromosome , making color blindness more common in males than in females because males have only one X chromosome , while females have two .
In addition , some color blind people find it easier to distinguish problem colors on artificial materials , such as plastic or in acrylic paints , than on natural materials , such as paper or wood .
Good graphic design avoids using color coding or using color contrasts alone to express information ; this not only helps color blind people , but also aids understanding by normally sighted people .
The most common are redâ `` green hereditary photoreceptor disorders , but it is also possible to acquire color blindness through damage to the retina , optic nerve , or higher brain areas .
Color blindness is usually classed as a mild disability , but in certain situations , color blind individuals have an advantage over those with normal color vision .

In colloquial American English , the word `` bandage '' is often used to mean a dressing , which is used directly on a wound , whereas a bandage is technically only used to support a dressing , and not directly on a wound .
Messenger RNA -LRB- mRNA -RRB- is the RNA that carries information from DNA to the ribosome , the sites of protein synthesis -LRB- translation -RRB- in the cell .
The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form with the help of tRNA . In prokaryotic cells , which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments , mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA .
Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules : 18S , 5.8 S , 28S and 5S rRNA .

Atropine is a core medicine in the World Health Organization 's `` Essential Drugs List '' , which is a list of minimum medical needs for a basic health care system .
Pathogenesis in pulmonary venous hypertension -LRB- WHO Group II -RRB- is completely different .
Pulmonary venous hypertension is exceedingly common , since it occurs in most patients symptomatic with congestive heart failure .
In medicine , pulmonary hypertension -LRB- PH -RRB- is an increase in blood pressure in the pulmonary artery , pulmonary vein , or pulmonary capillaries , together known as the lung vasculature , leading to shortness of breath , dizziness , fainting , and other symptoms , all of which are exacerbated by exertion . Pulmonary hypertension can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance and heart failure .
Whatever the initial cause , pulmonary arterial hypertension -LRB- WHO Group I -RRB- involves the vasoconstriction or tightening of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs .
In hypoxic pulmonary hypertension -LRB- WHO Group III -RRB- , the low levels of oxygen are thought to cause vasoconstriction or tightening of pulmonary arteries . This leads to a similar pathophysiology as pulmonary arterial hypertension .
Instead , the left heart fails to pump blood efficiently , leading to pooling of blood in the lungs .
Therefore it becomes harder and harder for the left side of the heart to pump to supply sufficient oxygen to the rest of the body , especially during physical activity .
Fielding first met Barratt after seeing him perform his solo stand-up routine at the Hellfire Comedy Club in the Wycombe Swan theater .
Like other organs of the lymphatic system , some believe them to be involved in helping fight off pharyngeal and upper respiratory tract infections , but there is no conclusive evidence to that effect .
The human palatine tonsils and the nasopharyngeal tonsil are lymphoepithelial tissues located near the oropharynx and nasopharynx , although most commonly the term `` tonsils '' refers to the palatine tonsils -LRB- that can be seen in the back of the throat -RRB- .
An inflammation of the tonsils is called tonsillitis , which causes one 's tonsils to become sore and swollen .
Tetanus toxin is the neurotoxin produced by the vegetative cell of Clostridium tetani in anaerobic conditions , causing tetanus .
Lymph nodes are located at intervals along the lymphatic system . Several afferent lymph vessels bring in lymph , which percolates through the substance of the lymph node , and is drained out by an efferent lymph vessel .

The Nobel Prize in Physics is awarded once a year by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901 ; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry , Nobel Prize in Literature , Nobel Peace Prize , and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine .
This can be overcome by using pins and input meant for the second joystick -LRB- i.e. button 5 through 8 are mapped to the signals to the axis pins meant for the second joystick - resulting in the issue of the two buttons mapped to the same axis being not simultaneously usable -RRB- , using some normally `` unused '' pins , or changing the joystick 's circuits -LRB- and related software -RRB- to read a 4-bit state code from the four button inputs , thus giving up to 16 button combinations -LRB- albeit with some limitations e.g. some buttons may not be held down -RRB- or a combination of both techniques .
The typical implementation of a game port uses a capacitor and a simple voltage comparator , which together form a sort of crude ramp-compare ADC , which needs to be periodically polled and reset at precise moments to read an input , something that must be done several times -LRB- generally above 30 -RRB- per second to provide a responsive game input , and the actual acquisition frequency and value typically depend on the joystick 's internal resistance , noise , CPU speed and the total joystick-capacitor 's RC time constant .
Thermometers are another application of thermal expansion â '' most contain a liquid -LRB- usually mercury or alcohol -RRB- which is constrained to flow in only one direction -LRB- along the tube -RRB- due to changes in volume brought about by changes in temperature .
St Albans has a thriving cultural life , with regular concerts and theater productions held at venues including St Albans Abbey , Maltings Arts Theatre , the Alban Arena , the Abbey Theatre , St Peter 's Church and St Saviour 's Church , given by numerous organizations including St Albans Bach Choir , St Albans Cathedral Choir , St Albans Abbey Girl 's Choir , St Albans Symphony Orchestra , St Albans Chamber Choir , St Albans Chamber Opera , The Company of Ten , St Albans Choral Society , and St Albans Organ Theatre .

If the level of respiration is inappropriate for the body 's status then dyspnea might occur . It is worth noting that there is a psychological component of dyspnea as well , as some people may become aware of their breathing in such circumstances but not experience the distress typical of dyspnea .
Fats consist of a wide group of compounds that are generally soluble in organic solvents and largely insoluble in water .
A fumarole -LRB- Latin fumus , smoke -RRB- is an opening in a planet 's crust , often in the neighborhood of volcanoes , which emits steam and gases such as carbon dioxide , sulfur dioxide , hydrochloric acid , and hydrogen sulfide .
He also wrote in the Illustrated London News that he had `` been compelled , by laborious literary occupation , to abandon the practice of chess , beyond the indulgence of an occasional game ... If Mr. Morphy â '' for whose skill we entertain the liveliest admiration â '' be desirous to win his spurs among the chess chivalry of Europe , he must take advantage of his purposed visit next year ; he will then meet in this country , in France , in Germany and in Russia , many champions ... ready to test and do honor to his prowess .

The post of DCI was established by President Harry Truman on January 23 , 1946 , with Admiral Sidney Souers occupying the position ; it thus predates the establishment of the Central Intelligence Agency .
Metal arsenides react with acids to form highly toxic arsine gas .
Industrial production of selenium often involves the extraction of selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper . Common production begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium dioxide .
In plants , it occurs as a bystander mineral , sometimes in toxic proportions in forage -LRB- some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals , but other plants such as locoweed require selenium , and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil -RRB- .
The selenium dioxide is then mixed with water and the solution is acidified to form selenous acid -LRB- oxidation step -RRB- . Selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide -LRB- reduction step -RRB- to give elemental selenium .
Other selenides include mercury selenide -LRB- HgSe -RRB- , lead selenide -LRB- PbSe -RRB- , and zinc selenide -LRB- ZnSe -RRB- .
This is because a male cat 's penis has a band of about 120 â `` 150 backwards-pointing spines , which are about one millimeter long ; upon withdrawal of the penis , the spines rake the walls of the female 's vagina , which is a trigger for ovulation .
After mating , the female will wash her vulva thoroughly .
The low fitness of the hybrids would cause selection to favor assortative mating , which would control hybridization .
Diane Dodd was also able to show how reproductive isolation can develop from mating preferences in Drosophila pseudoobscura fruit flies after only eight generations using different food types , starch and maltose .
Some evidence , such as the fact that six out of thirteen allozyme loci are different , that hawthorn flies mature later in the season and take longer to mature than apple flies ; and that there is little evidence of interbreeding -LRB- researchers have documented a 4-6 % hybridization rate -RRB- suggests that sympatric speciation is occurring .
The idea that natural selection affects bacteria has profound consequences , for example , it explains how bacteria develop antibiotic resistance .
His famous experiment with DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck in 1943 , known as the Luria-Delbr Ã 1\/4 ck experiment , demonstrated statistically that inheritance in bacteria must follow Darwinian rather than Lamarckian principles and that mutant bacteria occurring randomly can still bestow viral resistance without the virus being present .
While investigating how a culture of E. coli was able to stop the production of phages , Luria discovered that specific bacterial strains produce enzymes that cut DNA at certain sequences .
Salvador Edward Luria -LRB- Turin , August 13 , 1912 -- Lexington , February 6 , 1991 -RRB- was an Italian microbiologist and a Nobel laureate -LRB- Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine -RRB- for his pioneering work with Max DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck and Alfred Hershey on phages in molecular biology .
Studies in the 1990s at Boxgrove , in which a butcher attempted to cut up a carcass with a hand axe , revealed that the hand axe was perfect for getting at the bone marrow , which is high in protein and vitamins and thus was likely highly prized as a food source .

Additionally , Austin suffered fractured bones in his hand from the side slam he took from Booker into an announce table .
The WWF faction battered their enemy tag partners off the ring apron over and over again making them appear weak and more times than not , the ECW-WCW grapplers gained an advantage only by double-teaming or employing underhanded tactics .
Stone Cold then dragged a referee into the ring , but in a swerve , kicked Kurt Angle in the stomach , hit him with a Stunner , and placed Booker T on top of Kurt Angle and told the referee to count .
While Vince was in the ring , Booker T came from behind to deliver his trademark scissor kick to Vince .
Vince McMahon replied that Shane was somewhat accurate in his accusations but ceded that it was wrong for him to back Stone Cold , as he was a rattlesnake that he should have known would eventually bite him .
The Rock , however , gave Vince a Rock Bottom and proceeded to shake Shane 's hand , but he then proceeded to Rock Bottom him as well .
For fans who did n't catch it the fifth , tenth or twentieth time they 've run the angle , `` Stone Cold '' Steve Austin and Vince McMahon are about to feud once again ... First up was Vincent McMahon labeling Austin with a steel chair as he was waiting to put a dazed RVD away ... Three minutes later , it was Shane McMahon 's turn to hurl Kurt Angle out of the ring and into a steel ring post .
Because of this announcement , many Alliance members began to distrust Stone Cold , looking at him with suspicious eyes , to which Stone Cold vehemently denied the charges and called Vince a liar .
Back in the ring , Austin laid a `` Stone Cold '' Stunner on to retain the belt as a disgruntled Vince scowled .
`` While it was good TV , it was n't what everyone thought the WCW vs WWF would have been all about ... When the fans of WWF and WCW reminisced about a WCW vs WWF match back in the glory days of Monday Night Wars of around 1997 , their match would have probably gone like this : WCW would probably have a team of Hollywood Hulk Hogan , Scott Hall , Kevin Nash , Goldberg , and Ric Flair against ... maybe the WWF team of Stone Cold Steve Austin , The Rock , the Undertaker , Shawn Michaels , and Mick Foley .
The WWF gained even more momentum at Unforgiven , as The Rock retained the WCW Championship in a handicap match against Booker T and Shane McMahon , and Kurt Angle made Austin submit to the ankle lock , winning the WWF Championship from Stone Cold , putting both belts into the hands of the WWF .
In anatomy , the scapula , omo -LRB- Medical Latin -RRB- , or shoulder blade , is the bone that connects the humerus -LRB- upper arm bone -RRB- with the clavicle -LRB- collar bone -RRB- .

King Henry VI was originally buried in Chertsey Abbey ; then , in 1485 , his body was moved to St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle .
Porcupines ' quills , or spines , take on various forms , depending on the species , but all are modified hairs coated with thick plates of keratin , and they are embedded in the skin musculature .
When a plant cell is placed in a hypertonic solution , the water in the cells moves to an area higher in solute concentration and the cell shrinks , and in doing so , becomes flaccid . This means the cell has become plasmolysed â `` the cell membrane has completely left the cell wall due to lack of water pressure on it ; the opposite of turgid .
The term adrenaline is derived from the Latin roots ad - and renes and literally means `` on the kidney '' , in reference to the adrenal gland 's anatomic location on the kidney . The Greek roots epi and nephros have similar meanings , and give rise to `` epinephrine '' .

In addition to the specialised endocrine organs mentioned above , many other organs that are part of other body systems , such as the kidney , liver , heart and gonads , have secondary endocrine functions . For example the kidney secretes endocrine hormones such as erythropoietin and renin .
Some terrestrial species lack both lungs and gills and perform gas exchange through their skin , a process known as valerian respiration in which the capillary beds are spread throughout the epidermis , and inside the mouth .
In the lungless salamanders , muscles surrounding the hyoid bone contract to create pressure and actually `` shoot '' the hyoid bone out of the mouth along with the tongue .
Many of the highly aquatic species , however , have no muscles in the tongue , and do not use it for capturing prey , while most other species have a mobile tongue , but without the adaptations to the hyoid bone .
Salamanders also secrete poison from glands in their skin , and some additionally have skin glands for secreting courtship pheromones .
The skin of salamanders secretes mucus , which helps keep the animal moist when on dry land , and maintains their salt balance while in water , as well as providing a lubricant during swimming .
Muscles in the pelvic region are used in order to reel the tongue and the hyoid back to its original position .

The degree was first awarded by Harvard University in the United States in the late 19th century and was created as a modern version of the old European doctor of law degree -LRB- such as the Dottore in Giurisprudenza in Italy and the Juris Utriusque Doctor in Germany and Central Europe -RRB- .
Emergency contraception -LRB- EC -RRB- , or emergency postcoital contraception , refers to birth control measures that , if taken after sexual intercourse , may prevent pregnancy .
A Massachusetts law that went into effect on 14 December 2005 requires all hospitals in the state to provide emergency contraception to any `` female rape victim of childbearing age '' including Catholic Hospitals who oppose the provision of emergency contraception . In a letter criticizing the joint UN\/WHO Inter-agency Field Manual on Reproductive Health in Refugee Situations , the Catholic Church explains its belief that emergency contraception , along with IUDs and hormonal contraception , can not be considered `` solely contraceptive because in the case of effective fertilization a chemical abortion would be carried out during the first days of pregnancy . ''
The outcome for coma and vegetative state depends on the cause , location , severity and extent of neurological damage . A deeper coma alone does not necessarily mean a slimmer chance of recovery , because some people in deep coma recover well while others in a so-called milder coma sometimes fail to improve .

Vehicle insurance -LRB- also known as auto insurance , car insurance , or motor insurance -RRB- is insurance purchased for cars , trucks , and other road vehicles .
The pollen tube of most seed plants acts as a conduit to transport sperm cells from the pollen grain , either from the stigma -LRB- in flowering plants or angiosperms -RRB- to the ovules at the base of the pistil , or directly through ovule tissue in some gymnosperms -LRB- conifers and gnetophytes -RRB- .
In maize , this single cell can grow longer than 12 inches to traverse the length of the pistil .
One sperm unites with the egg cell to produce the embryo of a new plant , while a second sperm unites with the central cell -LRB- polar nuclei -RRB- to produce the endosperm of the seed .
In angiosperms the pollen tube germinates from the pollen grain and grows the entire length through the stigma , style , ovary and ovules to reach the eggs .
The sperm cells by themselves are not motile and are carried within the tube .
Like ferns , other basal land plants , and many algae , these gymnosperms have flagellate sperm , which swim through a watery fluid to fertilize the egg cells .
As the tip of the tube reaches a synergid , it bursts and releases two sperm cells leading to a double fertilization .
In other gymnosperms -LRB- Ginkgo and cycads -RRB- the pollen tube is involved only in nutrient uptake from ovule tissue by the pollen grain , and does not convey sperm cells to the egg .
The lifetime risk for breast cancer in the United States is usually given as about 1 in 8 -LRB- 12 % -RRB- of women by age 95 , with a 1 in 35 -LRB- 3 % -RRB- chance of dying from breast cancer .
In 2007 , breast cancer was expected to cause 40,910 deaths in the US -LRB- 7 % of cancer deaths ; almost 2 % of all deaths -RRB- .

This works by convection ; the heat is transferred from the relatively warm object to the relatively cold coolant .
Absolute zero is also 0 Â R on the Rankine scale , another thermodynamic temperature scale , and â ' 459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale .
Fluids used to cool objects are commonly called coolants .
Air cooling is the process of cooling an object by exposing it to air .
The coldest theoretically possible temperature is absolute zero , also called absolute temperature , which is 0 K on the Kelvin scale , a thermodynamic temperature scale , and â ' 273.15 Â C on the Celsius scale .
Another common method of cooling is exposing an object to ice , dry ice , or liquid nitrogen .
This will only work if the air is at a lower temperature than the object , and the process can be enhanced by increasing the surface area or decreasing the mass of the object .

The governor of the state in which the disaster occurs must declare a state of emergency and formally request from the president that FEMA and the federal government respond to the disaster .
The only exception is when an emergency and\/or disaster occurs on federal property or to a federal asset , for example , the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma , or the Space Shuttle Columbia in the 2003 return-flight disaster .
Today FEMA exists as a major agency of the Department of Homeland Security . The Administrator for Federal Emergency Management reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency -LRB- FEMA -RRB- is an agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security , initially created by Presidential Order on 1 April 1979 .
The primary purpose of FEMA is to coordinate the response to a disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms the resources of local and state authorities .
How the concentrations of ions and the membrane transport proteins influence the value of the resting potential is outlined below .

The circulation became better defined as convection modestly increased over the center , and within six hours of its development the system transitioned into a tropical depression .
Officials in New Orleans opened three emergency shelters , citing the potential need of shelter for citizens in about 17,000 FEMA trailers after Hurricane Katrina .
As the depression tracked into Alabama , it became increasingly disorganized , and the system dissipated as a tropical cyclone early on September 22 .
The cyclone continued tracking northwestward , making landfall around 0000 UTC on September 22 near Fort Walton Beach , Florida with winds of 35 mph -LRB- 55 km\/h -RRB- .
The upper-level low over the Florida Panhandle increased convection across the area , and on September 18 the system began crossing Florida .
In Mississippi , Governor Haley Barbour declared a state of emergency .
The combination of wind shear and low-level helicity produced moderate convection across central Florida in association with the precursor low pressure system .
Convection gradually became better organized , with a well-defined band in its eastern semicircle and intermittent thunderstorm activity near the center .
Late on September 20 , a supercell developed near Lake Apopka , and tracking quickly northward it spawned an EF1 tornado near Eustis ; the tornado tracked about 2 miles -LRB- 3 km -RRB- and reached winds of about 100 mph -LRB- 160 km\/h -RRB- .
Additionally , the New Orleans National Weather Service issued a coastal flood watch for four parishes in southeastern Louisiana .
Despite an overall disorganized structure , with a poorly defined circulation and an upper-level low aloft , the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Subtropical Depression Ten at 1500 UTC on September 21 while it was located about 40 miles -LRB- 60 km -RRB- south of St. Vincent Island , Florida , citing `` the potential for additional development right along the coastline . ''
The system developed as a subtropical depression on September 21 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico from the interaction of a tropical wave , the tail end of a cold front , and an upper-level low .
Tracking northwestward , the depression moved ashore near Fort Walton Beach early on September 22 , and shortly thereafter it dissipated over southeastern Alabama .
Coinciding with the first advisory on the depression , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning from Apalachicola , Florida westward to the mouth of the Mississippi River .
Initially very disorganized , surface pressures gradually decreased across the region , with a weak low pressure area developing on September 19 .
Tropical Depression Ten was a short-lived tropical cyclone that made landfall on the Florida Panhandle in September 2007 .
Shortly thereafter , an inland tropical storm warning was issued for Pearl River , Walthall , and Pike counties in Mississippi and Washington Parish in Louisiana .
The cloud pattern deteriorated as it tracked inland , and 3 hours after it moved ashore the National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the depression .
Exxon Mobil cut its output by about 1,000 barrels of oil and 55000 f. With 27.7 % of the daily crude oil production halted due to the depression , oil prices rose further after days of increasing levels , and on September 20 reached a record rate of over $ 84 per barrel .
A reconnaissance aircraft flight into the system on September 20 reported a well-defined low and strong wind gusts in squalls as the system tracked into the northeastern Gulf of Mexico , along with limited and disorganized thunderstorm activity .
Due to the threat of the cyclone , Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco declared a state of emergency and placed the state 's National Guard and other disaster services on reserve .
By September 17 , the system produced widespread thunderstorm activity over the Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean .
Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for residents in shallow areas and in mobile homes for Jackson , Harrison , and Hancock counties .
As a result , it was forecast to attain winds of 45 mph -LRB- 75 km\/h -RRB- and move ashore along southern Mississippi .
With a mid-level ridge to its northwest , the subtropical depression was anticipated to parallel the coastline of the Gulf Coast of the United States .
Metastatic breast cancer is a complex multi-step process involving the expansion of cancerous cells from the breast to other areas of the body . It is a serious complication of breast cancer , as metastatic disease in breast cancer is often fatal , with treatments mainly limited to palliation .

Pain can be classed according to its location in the body , as in headache , low back pain and pelvic pain ; or according to the body system involved , such as myofascial pain -LRB- emanating from skeletal muscles or the fibrous sheath surrounding them -RRB- , rheumatic pain -LRB- emanating from the joints and surrounding tissue -RRB- , neuropathic pain -LRB- caused by damage or illness affecting the somatosensory system -RRB- , or vascular -LRB- pain from blood vessels -RRB- .
Pain that lasts a long time is called chronic , and pain that resolves quickly is called acute . Traditionally , the distinction between acute and chronic pain has relied upon an arbitrary interval of time from onset ; the two most commonly used markers being 3 months and 6 months since the onset of pain , though some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at 12 months .
It is a type of neuropathic pain .
Others apply acute to pain that lasts less than 30 days , chronic to pain of more than six months duration , and subacute to pain that lasts from one to six months . A popular alternative definition of chronic pain , involving no arbitrarily fixed durations is `` pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing . ''
Some `` scientific laws '' appear to be mathematical definitions -LRB- e.g. , Newton 's Second law F = , or the uncertainty principle , or the principle of least action , or causality -RRB- .
Nor should ` physical law ' be confused with ` law of physics ' - the term ` physical law ' usually covers laws in other sciences -LRB- e.g. biology -RRB- as well .
The production of a summary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of science .
Empirical laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific experiments and simple observations , over many years , and which have become accepted universally within the scientific community .
A physical law or scientific law is a scientific generalization based on empirical observations of physical behavior -LRB- i.e. the law of nature -RRB- .
Laws of nature are distinct from religious and civil law , and should not be confused with the concept of natural law .
Active infrared night vision is now commonly found in commercial , residential and government security applications , where it enables effective night time imaging under low light conditions . However , since active infrared light can be detected by night vision goggles , there can be a risk of giving away position in tactical military operations .
Night vision is the ability to see in low light conditions .
The agent stimulates the body 's immune system to recognize the agent as foreign , destroy it , and `` remember '' it , so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters .
Finally , a microneedle approach , which is still in stages of development , seems to be the vaccine of the future , the microneedle , which is `` pointed projections fabricated into arrays that can create vaccine delivery pathways through the skin '' .
Vaccines are dead or inactivated organisms or purified products derived from them .
Possible methods include liposomes and ISCOM -LRB- immune stimulating complex -RRB- .
Cultured mammalian cells are expected to become increasingly important , compared to conventional options such as chicken eggs , due to greater productivitity and low incidence of problems with contamination .
Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for public health .
Sometimes , this is because the host 's immune system simply does not respond adequately or at all .
In some instances , wild populations may be vaccinated .
Combination vaccines are expected to reduce the quantities of antigens they contain , and thereby decrease undesirable interactions , by using pathogen-associated molecular patterns .
Where rabies occurs , rabies vaccination of dogs may be required by law .
Adjuvants are typically used to boost immune response .
A monovalent vaccine is designed to immunize against a single antigen or single microorganism .
A multivalent or polyvalent vaccine is designed to immunize against two or more strains of the same microorganism , or against two or more microorganisms .
Although controversial claims have been made that thiomersal contributes to autism , no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims .
Major achievements included the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s and the eradication of smallpox during the 1960s and 1970s .
Both animals kept as pets and animals raised as livestock are routinely vaccinated .
Vaccine production techniques are evolving .
Vaccines may be monovalent -LRB- also called univalent -RRB- or multivalent -LRB- also called polyvalent -RRB- .
The number of vaccines actually administered has risen dramatically in recent decades .
For example , the experimental vaccine CYT006-AngQb has been investigated as a possible treatment for high blood pressure .
Some religious groups do not allow vaccination , and some political groups oppose mandatory vaccination on the grounds of individual liberty .
Most vaccine development to date has relied on `` push '' funding by government , universities and non-profit organizations .
In certain cases a monovalent vaccine may be preferable for rapidly developing a strong immune response .
The filing of patents on vaccine development processes can also be viewed as an obstacle to the development of new vaccines .
With an oral vaccine , there is no risk of blood contamination .
Physiotherapy clinics are usually operated by physiotherapists and psychology clinics by clinical psychologists , and so on for each health profession .
Some clinics function as a place for people with injuries or illnesses to come and be seen by triage nurse or other health worker .
Clinics are often associated with general medical practice , run by one or several general practitioners or practice managers .
In China , for example , owners of those clinics do not have formal medical education .
Doctors at such clinics can often refer patients to specialists if the need arises .
Sewage treatment generally involves three stages , called primary , secondary and tertiary treatment .
They were part of the early CBGB punk rock movement that had emerged in New York .
The Cramps are noted as influencing a number of musical styles : not only are they one of the first garage punk bands but also the first known band to blend punk rock with rockabilly , The Cramps are widely recognized as one of the prime innovators of psychobilly , and they inspired many of the early goth rock bands .
Cold Spring is a city in Campbell County , Kentucky , United States .
A human being can be infected by a single bacterium .

Her ground-breaking work on cancer epidemiology was carried on by Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill , who published `` Lung Cancer and Other Causes of Death In Relation to Smoking .
His contemporary Nicolaes Tulp believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads , and concluded that it was contagious .
Over the past 50 years , great efforts have been spent on gathering data across medical practice , hospital , provincial , state , and even country boundaries to study the interdependence of environmental and cultural factors on cancer incidence .
With the widespread use of the microscope in the 18th century , it was discovered that the ` cancer poison ' spread from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites -LRB- `` metastasis '' -RRB- .
With the exception of William Coley who in the late 19th century felt that the rate of cure after surgery had been higher before asepsis -LRB- and who injected bacteria into tumors with mixed results -RRB- , cancer treatment became dependent on the individual art of the surgeon at removing a tumor .
The work of other individual physicians led to various insights , but when physicians started working together they could make firmer conclusions .
Many management options for cancer exist including : chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery , immunotherapy , monoclonal antibody therapy and other methods .
The oldest known description and surgical treatment of cancer was discovered in Egypt and dates back to approximately 1600 BC .
The first cause of cancer was identified by British surgeon Percivall Pott , who discovered in 1775 that cancer of the scrotum was a common disease among chimney sweeps .
The renowned Scottish surgeon Alexander Monro saw only 2 breast tumor patients out of 60 surviving surgery for two years .
He later added the suffix - oma , Greek for swelling , giving the name carcinoma .
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for skin cancer , oral cancer , lung cancer , or prostate cancer in men under 75 . Routine screening is not recommended for bladder cancer , testicular cancer , ovarian cancer , pancreatic cancer , or prostate cancer in men over 75 .
With radiation also came the first signs of multi-disciplinary approaches to cancer treatment .
According to the patient 's humor , treatment consisted of diet , blood-letting , and\/or laxatives .
The use of surgery to treat cancer had poor results due to problems with hygiene .
In the 19th century , asepsis improved surgical hygiene and as the survival statistics went up , surgical removal of the tumor became the primary treatment for cancer .
Hippocrates -LRB- ca .
He stated that the excision should be radical and that all diseased tissue should be removed , which included the use of amputation or the removal of veins running in the direction of the tumor .
In the 16th and 17th centuries , it became more acceptable for doctors to dissect bodies to discover the cause of death .
Richard Doll left the London Medical Research Center -LRB- MRC -RRB- , to start the Oxford unit for Cancer epidemiology in 1968 .
Galen -LRB- 2nd century AD -RRB- called benign tumors oncos , Greek for swelling , reserving Hippocrates ' carcinos for malignant tumors .
Similarly , physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer , breast cancer , or brain cancer .
Modern epidemiological methods are closely linked to current concepts of disease and public health policy .
This name comes from the appearance of the cut surface of a solid malignant tumor , with `` the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet , whence it derives its name '' .
Cancer patient treatment and studies were restricted to individual physicians ' practices until World War II , when medical research centers discovered that there were large international differences in disease incidence .
370 BC -RRB- described several kinds of cancers , referring to them with the Greek word carcinos -LRB- crab or crayfish -RRB- , among others .
The German professor Wilhelm Fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct .
Since it was against Greek tradition to open the body , Hippocrates only described and made drawings of outwardly visible tumors on the skin , nose , and breasts .
The surgeon was no longer operating in isolation , but worked together with hospital radiologists to help patients .
A founding paper of cancer epidemiology was the work of Janet Lane-Claypon , who published a comparative study in 1926 of 500 breast cancer cases and 500 control patients of the same background and lifestyle for the British Ministry of Health .
The Papyrus describes 8 cases of ulcers of the breast that were treated by cauterization , with a tool called `` the fire drill . ''
The complications in communication this brought , along with the necessity of the patient 's treatment in a hospital facility rather than at home , also created a parallel process of compiling patient data into hospital files , which in turn led to the first statistical patient studies .
The writing says about the disease , `` There is no treatment . ''
Treatment was based on the humor theory of four bodily fluids -LRB- black and yellow bile , blood , and phlegm -RRB- .
A Second Report on the Mortality of British Doctors '' followed in 1956 -LRB- otherwise known as the British doctors study -RRB- .
He also recommended the use of cauterization for the area treated if necessary .
Through the centuries it was discovered that cancer could occur anywhere in the body , but humor-theory based treatment remained popular until the 19th century with the discovery of cells .
The Dutch professor Francois de la Boe Sylvius , a follower of Descartes , believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes , and that acidic lymph fluid was the cause of cancer .
Another very early surgical treatment for cancer was described in the 1020s by Avicenna -LRB- Ibn Sina -RRB- in The Canon of Medicine .
The age of cellular pathology was born .
The Japanese medical community observed that the bone marrow of victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was completely destroyed .
This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan between 1871 and 1874 .
This insight drove national public health bodies to make it possible to compile health data across practises and hospitals , a process that many countries do today .
With the use of computers , the unit was the first to compile large amounts of cancer data .
During the same period , the idea that the body was made up of various tissues , that in turn were made up of millions of cells , laid rest the humor-theories about chemical imbalances in the body .
They concluded that diseased bone marrow could also be destroyed with radiation , and this led to the discovery of bone marrow transplants for leukemia .
When Marie Curie and Pierre Curie discovered radiation at the end of the 19th century , they stumbled upon the first effective non-surgical cancer treatment .
Decreased desire to eat is termed anorexia , while polyphagia -LRB- or `` hyperphagia '' -RRB- is increased eating . Dysregulation of appetite contributes to anorexia nervosa , bulimia nervosa , cachexia , overeating , and binge eating disorder .
A watering can is a portable container , usually with a handle and a spout , used to water plants by hand .

Both viral and bacterial causes of kennel cough are spread through the air by infected dogs sneezing and coughing .
It is highly contagious , even days or weeks after symptoms disappear .
Symptoms begin usually 3 to 5 days after exposure .
Most kennels will not board dogs without proof of vaccination .
Cough suppressants are used if the cough is not productive -LRB- nothing is being coughed up -RRB- .
It is so named because the infection can spread quickly among dogs , such as in the close quarters of a kennel .
In kennels , the best prevention is to keep all the cages disinfected .
Gillespie had two funerals .

The remnants of the depression persisted until 2 am EDT -LRB- 0600 UTC -RRB- on May 30 , at which time it was absorbed by a warm front , south of Nova Scotia .
Around 7:30 pm EDT -LRB- 2330 UTC -RRB- , a QuickSCAT satellite pass over the depression found tropical storm-force winds ; however , the winds were determined to have been affected by rain and therefore not representative of the depression 's actual intensity .
Tropical Depression One was also the farthest north a May tropical cyclone is known to have formed , according to the NHC 's Tropical Cyclone Report .
The NHC issued their final outlook on the low around 8 pm EDT -LRB- 0000 UTC on May 28 -RRB- while the system was located about 90 mi -LRB- 150 km -RRB- east of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina , as development of the low was not expected .
At 5:00 pm EDT -LRB- 2100 UTC -RRB- the NHC issued their final advisory on Tropical Depression One .
When Tropical Depression One formed on May 28 , it marked the third time since 1851 , when reliable records in the Atlantic basin began , that a pre-season cyclone developed in three consecutive years , following Subtropical Storm Andrea which formed in May of 2007 and Tropical Storm Arthur in May of 2008 .
The first occurrence of this was in 1932 , 1933 , and 1934 , and the second occurrence were the years of 1951 , 1952 , and 1953 .
Around 11:00 am EDT -LRB- 1500 UTC -RRB- , they designated the system as Tropical Depression One while it was located about 310 mi -LRB- 500 km -RRB- south of Providence , Rhode Island .
After a burst in convective activity overnight , shower and thunderstorm activity waned once more by 3:00 am EDT -LRB- 0700 UTC -RRB- .
Early on May 29 , Tropical Depression One nearly attained tropical storm status , with intensity estimates using the Dvorak Technique reaching T2 .5 , or 40 mph -LRB- 65 km\/h -RRB- ; however , the estimates were also as low as T1 .5 , leading to the intensity of the depression remaining at 35 mph -LRB- 55 km\/h -RRB- .
On May 27 , the National Hurricane Center -LRB- NHC -RRB- began issuing Tropical Weather Outlooks for the low while it was located about 120 miles -LRB- 195 kilometers -RRB- south of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina .
The following day , an area of low pressure developed along the boundary about 290 miles -LRB- 465 km -RRB- south-southwest of Wilmington , North Carolina .

Avicenna also `` described diabetes insipidus very precisely for the first time '' , though it was later Johann Peter Frank -LRB- 1745 â `` 1821 -RRB- who first differentiated between diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus .
Diabetes mellitus due to a known defect are classified separately . Type 2 diabetes is the most common type .
Other forms of diabetes mellitus include congenital diabetes , which is due to genetic defects of insulin secretion , cystic fibrosis-related diabetes , steroid diabetes induced by high doses of glucocorticoids , and several forms of monogenic diabetes .
There is no known preventive measure against type 1 diabetes , which causes approximately 10 % of diabetes mellitus cases in North America and Europe .
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease which is difficult to cure .
Most cases of diabetes mellitus fall into three broad categories : type 1 , type 2 , and gestational diabetes .

Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and can produce sharper changes in weather .
Ambulance trusts and services may also undertake non-urgent patient transport services on a commercial arrangement with their local hospital trusts or health boards , or in some cases on directly funded government contracts . This is an area where an increasing amount of private firms are taking business away from the trusts .
Both organizations also provide `` reserve '' or `` support '' cover to some , though not all , of the ambulance trusts , dependent on the local MOU , where ambulance crews from one of the organizations -LRB- who are usually volunteers , but in some instances may be paid staff -RRB- will attend 999 , GP Urgent or PTS calls on behalf of the ambulance trust , with the organization receiving recompense from the trust .
The Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust -LRB- also called Ymddiriedolaeth GIG Gwasanaethau Ambiwlans Cymru -RRB- was established on 1 April 1998 , and has 2,500 staff providing ambulance and related services to the 2.9 million residents of Wales .
Following consultation , on 1 July 2006 , the number of ambulance trusts fell from 29 to 13 .
Emergency medical services are provided through local ambulance services , known in England and Wales as trusts .
This service is most often called on during major incidents -LRB- e.g. the 7 July 2005 London bombings -RRB- , when there is a high level of staff absence or when there is an unusually high call volume , although in some areas , voluntary crews are regularly used to supplement full time trust cover .
Both organizations have also provided cover for the public on the very rare occasions when unionised NHS ambulance trust staff have taken industrial action .
The main voluntary ambulance providers are the British Red Cross and St. John Ambulance , which have been providing emergency medical cover in the UK for many years , including active service in both World Wars -LRB- pre-dating the existence of any government organised service -RRB- , and along with St Andrews Ambulance -LRB- now St Andrews First Aid , which no longer provides an ambulance service -RRB- ran statutory ambulance services in the United Kingdom under contract to the government until a reorganisation in 1974 . The primary activity of both organizations in relation to ambulances , is the provision of covers at events as an extension of their first aid contract .
Some organisers use a private firm instead of a voluntary ambulance service because of wider availability during the week -LRB- sometimes difficult for a voluntary service to cover -RRB- or for a wider range of skills , such as provision of qualified paramedics .
It responds to medical emergencies in Northern Ireland with the 270 plus ambulances at its disposal .

The Service employs approximately 1,044 staff based across 32 stations & sub-stations , four Control Centres and a Regional Training Centre .
Private ambulance services are becoming more common in the UK , performing a number of roles , including providing medical cover at large events , either alongside , or instead of the voluntary sector providers .
The Scottish Ambulance Service is a Special Health Board funded directly by the Health Department of the Scottish Government .
Ambulance trusts and services may also undertake non-urgent patient transport services on a commercial arrangement with their local hospital trusts or health boards , or in some cases on directly funded government contracts .
Each service in England is specific to a one or more local authority areas , and so the country is divided across a number of ambulance services , in a similar way to the Police .

The depression destroyed bridges , flooded villages and blocked roads .
However as the depression never reached storm strength tropical storm conditions never occurred along the watch areas .
The National Hurricane Center issued numerous tropical storm watches throughout the storm 's duration , while in Costa Rica a red alert warning was placed into effect across much of the country , and over 100,000 people were evacuated .
Tropical Depression Sixteen was only tropical cyclone not to intensify into a tropical storm during the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season .
Heavy rains from the depression 's remnant low left at least 75 people dead and six missing and forced a further 100,000 people from their homes across Central America .
The depression then relocated onshore and rapidly dissipated the next morning .
Heavy rainfall from the depression triggered deadly flooding in Central America which left at least 75 people dead , displaced 100,000 others , and caused at least $ 150 million in damage .
Total damage is estimated at about $ 150 million -LRB- 2008 USD -RRB- .
The host cell is now no longer useful to the virus , therefore the cell often dies and the newly produced viruses must find a new host .
During this time , the virus will not produce any progeny , it will remain inactive until external stimuli -LRB- such as light or stress -RRB- prompts it into activation .
It is only active when replicating within a host , using a hosts ' resources and food .
One of the ways a virus can be seen as living is that a virus needs to replicate and create progeny .
Some viruses can `` hide '' within another cell , either to evade the host cell defenses or immune system , or simply because it is not in the best interest of the virus to continually replicate .
After a virus has made many copies of itself , it usually has exhausted the cell of its resources .
Permissibility determines the outcome of the infection .
Attachment , or adsorption , occurs between the viral particle and the host cell membrane .
In order for the virus to reproduce and thereby establish infection , it must enter cells of the host organism and use those cells ' materials .
The process by which virus progeny are released to find new hosts , is called shedding .
After control is established and the environment is set for the virus to begin making copies of itself , replication occurs quickly .
It is usually only after a virus enters a host that it can gain access to possible susceptible cells .
It is at this stage a distinction between susceptibility and permissibility of a host cell is made .
Next , a virus must take control of the host cell 's replication mechanisms .
This is the final stage in the viral life cycle .
In order to enter the cells , proteins found on the surface of the virus interact with proteins of the cell .
This hiding is deemed latency .
However , unlike other organisms , a virus can not survive on its own .
Viruses are similar to living organisms , however there are differences .
Once inside a host , a virus 's sole purpose is to make as many copies of itself , and infect other host cells ; everything it does is to benefit its fitness and increase the number of its offspring .
It is commonly associated with playing tennis and other racquet sports , though the injury can happen to almost anybody .

Traditional viral culture has been generally superseded by shell vial culture , in which the sample is centrifuged onto a single layer of cells and viral growth is measured by antigen detection methods .
If the cells show changes , known as cytopathic effects , then the culture is positive .
Viral culture is a laboratory test in which samples are placed with a cell type that the virus being tested for is able to infect .
This greatly reduces the time to detection for slow growing viruses such as cytomegalovirus , for which the method was developed .

The depression made landfall at St. Catherines Island , Georgia , and moved inland , where it steadily weakened .
Other rainfall totals of 2 to 3 in -LRB- 50 to 75 mm -RRB- were common .
In Georgetown County , South Carolina , officials monitored the storm for potential needed actions .
Tracking through an area of cool water temperatures , as well as unfavorable upper-level winds , the depression failed to achieve winds greater than 35 mph -LRB- 55 km\/h -RRB- , and thus did not attain tropical storm status .
Initially , the depression tracked west-northwest at about 13 m , and most of the associated convection was separated from the center .
The system was embedded in an environment characterized by high surface pressures .
However , flood watches were posted for much of Georgia and South Carolina .
There were no reports of damage or casualties associated with this depression .
The storm continued a northwestward track for its entire existence , under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge and an approaching mid-level trough .
Early on July 26 it moved ashore on St. Catherines Island , Georgia , and after steadily weakening over land it dissipated on July 27 .
However , the cloud pattern became well-defined , and consisted of a number of curved banding features .
As the storm was never forecast to attain tropical storm status , no tropical storm warnings or watches were issued .
The seventh tropical cyclone of the season , the depression formed on July 25 from the same tropical wave that spawned previous Tropical Depression Six .
A mid - to lower-level circulation developed within the system as it tracked generally north-northwestward , and based on surface and satellite observations , it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven at 1200 UTC on July 25 about 60 miles -LRB- 95 km -RRB- east of Daytona Beach , Florida .
Prior to landfall , the highest winds were estimated to exist in a small area northeast of the center of circulation , where a well-defined band of clouds persisted .
A small and disorganized depression , it tracked northwest , and due to unfavorable conditions it remained below tropical storm intensity .
The depression dropped light to moderate rainfall from Florida to the coast of North Carolina , peaking at 5.17 inches -LRB- 131 mm -RRB- in Savannah , Georgia .
Because the storm was weak , effects were limited to heavy rainfall throughout portions of Florida , Georgia , South Carolina and North Carolina .
Tropical Depression Seven of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season was a weak tropical depression that formed off the northeast Florida coast .
A tropical wave , which had previously spawned Tropical Depression Six , interacted with an upper-level low pressure area to develop an area of deep convection near Hispaniola on July 23 , 2003 .
Testicular cancer has one of the highest cure rates of all cancers : in excess of 90 percent ; essentially 100 percent if it has not metastasized .

Itch -LRB- Latin : pruritus -RRB- is an unpleasant sensation that causes the desire or reflex to scratch .
Pain creates a withdrawal reflex while itch leads to a scratch reflex .
Often , however , scratching can intensify itching and even cause further damage to the skin , dubbed the `` itch-scratch-itch cycle '' .
Sometimes scratching relieves isolated itches , hence the existence of devices such as the back scratcher .
Some plant products have been found to be effective anti-pruritics , others not .
Modern science has shown that itch has many similarities to pain , and while both are unpleasant sensory experiences , their behavioral response patterns are different .
Methane is the main component of what we commonly refer to as natural gas .
Cold seeps develop unique topography over time , where reactions between methane and seawater create carbonate rock formations and reefs .
Type of cold seeps can be distinguished as according to the depth to shallows cold seeps and deep cold seeps .
The cyclone had no effect on land , and did not directly result in any fatalities or damage .
Tropical Depression Twelve formed over the southeastern Bahamas at 2100 UTC on August 23 , partially from the remains of Tropical Depression Ten .
The depression moved erratically and slowly towards the west , and wind shear inhabited any significant intensification .
On August 8 , a tropical wave emerged from the west coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic Ocean .
It formed on August 13 from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on August 8 .
Tropical Depression Twelve later became Hurricane Katrina .
Late on August 13 , it was `` beginning to look like Irene-junior as it undergoes southwesterly mid-level shear beneath the otherwise favorable upper-level outflow pattern '' .
At the time , it was located about 1600 m east of Barbados .
As a result of strong wind shear , the depression remained weak and did not strengthen beyond tropical depression status .
